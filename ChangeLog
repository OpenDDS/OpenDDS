        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/MulticastSendStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/MulticastSendStrategy.cpp:

          For the new async_send option, only create one ACE_Asynch_Write_Dgram
          object and make it a member of the MulticastSendStrategy class so
          it can attempt to cancel I/O during transport shutdown.

        * dds/DCPS/RTPS/Spdp.cpp:

          Moved forwarding of dissassociate_* functions to Sedp where
          they were a no-op, to just be a no-op in RtpsInfo where
          the DiscoveryInfo interface requires it.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ReceiveListenerSet.inl:

          The method for re-setting rd_ptr() when there are multiple
          listeners needs to account for the fact that continuation
          blocks also have their rd_ptr()s modified during demarshaling.

        * dds/DCPS/RTPS/Sedp.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/RTPS/Sedp.h:

          Storing associated_participants_ prior to writing the
          publication/subscription data. Changed add publication/
          subscription to have an invalid sequence number, so new
          sequence number can be used in set_header_fields.
