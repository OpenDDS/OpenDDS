        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:

          Modified the cancel_release logic to properly deal with
          already stopped links as well as links that are already
          scheduled.  This allows logic line from transport_shutdown
          to progress correctly.

          Fixed some reference counting issues with the reactor_task
          which were causing the multicast_async tests to fail due
          to the proactor not being released properly due to wrong
          ref counts.

          modified handle_exception to guard against the impl_ already
          going away before the callback.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/tcp/TcpTransport.cpp:

          Don't try to unbind from pending_release_links_ if release
          delay isn't set because links are only shifted to pending
          if there is a schedule_delayed_release.

          the receive strategy on the active side after a reconnect.
          This allows for multiple reconnects.  Second, properly
          suspend and resume the send strategy around a disconnect
          and subsequent reconnect.  This allows for samples published
          while disconnected to be received by the readers.

          For transports that notify that a connection was deleted, prolong
          the TransportClient's registration on the link as a listener until
          the datalink has a chance to notify it that the conneciton is
          indeed being deleted.  This allows the TransportSendListener or
          TransportReceiveListener to actually receive the callback and then
          finalize the removal of the TransportClient's knowledge of the link
          as well as removing the link's knowledge of the listener.
          The Data(Writer/Reader)Impl will then call into the TransportClient
          to register the receipt of the notification.

          This was used to find the two problems fixed last week and
          allows multiple writers/threads to publish to large number
          of subscriber processes (100s).

Mon Dec 15 15:44:19 UTC 2014  Peter Oschwald  <oschwaldp@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          No longer have to release the pub_handle_lock_ when
          disassociating which allows remove_associations to be
          a single transaction.

          Added some more detail to certain log statements to
          make debugging easier.

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Added logging of which subscriptions the writer is waiting
          for ack responses from.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.h:

          Added Reactor callback handle_exception for notify calls of
          schedule_stop and schedule_delayed_release to use the
          scheduled_to_stop_at_ time and scheduling_release_ flag to
          coordinate release.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:

          Added schedule_stop and reworked schedule_delayed_release
          to notify the reactor instead of directly interacting with
          the reactor.  This alleviates potential deadlock and moves
          the scheduling and cancelling of timers as well as the calls
          to stop all onto the reactor thread.  The reactor will call
          handle_exception which determines how to proceed based on
          whether scheduled_to_stop_at_ has been set and how it
          compares to the current time as well as if scheduling_release_
          is set.

          release_reservations can now happen as a transaction, holding
          the pub_sub_maps_lock the entire time.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportClient.cpp:

        * dds/DCPS/transport/tcp/TcpTransport.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/tcp/TcpTransport.cpp:

          Transport now notifies the reactor of the need to stop or
          schedule a delayed release to avoid reactor deadlock from
          this thread.  Stopping and Scheduling of timers now happens
          on the reactor thread when it calls handle_exception on the
          DataLink. This allows scope of links_lock_ to be expanded
          for entire transaction of the release.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportClient.cpp:

        * dds/DCPS/transport/tcp/TcpTransport.cpp:

          Added ability for passive side to reuse an existing
          connection when receiving a passive connect.  This
          occurs when the active side recognizes the datalink
          has been released and tries to make a new connection
          to the passive side before discovery has propagated
          the release to the passive side.  Passive side will
          now reuse the datalink but properly associate it with the
          reused connection.

          find_datalink_i now properly handles case of moving
          a pending release link back into the active links.

          Fixed an issue with the interleaving of cancel_release
          and schedule_delayed_release when releasing the datalink
          from TcpTransport.  Added intermediate state indicators:
          scheduling_release_, cancelled_release_, and
          scheduled_release_ to manage the interleaving correctly.

          Add a public_address config option for tcp.  This
          option allows a transport to explicitly specify
          an address that is used as the publicly advertised
          address (during discovery) for that instance.
          When not specified, the local_address is used,
          preserving the current behavior.

          This option is used in some reconnect testing but
          should also be useful for firewall traversal and
          other situations.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/tcp/TcpConnection.cpp:

          reconnect paths.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.h:

          Promote nested structs from protected to public, vc71 won't compile
          the TransportClient header when they are protected even though the
          friend declaration is present.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportConfig.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportConfig.cpp:

          If the passive_connect_duration_ is set to 0, treat it as the
          default value of 60 seconds.  With the async_assoc changes,
          0 will cause the timer to expire immediately and fail the association.

Wed Nov 19 19:16:30 UTC 2014  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * Merged the branch async_assoc which lets the association process,
          which sets up communication channels from matched writers to readers,
          proceed without blocking the thread that initiated it (discovery).
          This helps scalability, especially with RTPS's peer-to-peer discovery
          where each participant is processing associations on its own.
          For details see the branch-specific change log at
          docs/history/ChangeLog-async_assoc.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/tcp/TcpConnection.cpp:

          Make a couple of changes that prevent the Reconnect test
          from "leaking" threads on the subscriber side.  The main
          change is to explicitly tear down the link after the
          timer goes off indicating the reconnect delay is over.
          In addition, some doubly linked lists between the old
          and new connections were removed.

          Sleep in subscriber before deleting entities, so that

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          Disable use of END_HISTORIC_SAMPLES control messages
          with multicast DataLinks.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/MulticastDataLink.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/ReliableSession.cpp:

          Discard duplicate messages as defined by the DataSampleHeader
          GUID and sequence number.  These can occur with durability resending
          a data sample at the same time a nak-based resend occurs.
          Removing duplicates here is sufficient to provide the functionality
          that END_HISTORIC_SAMPLES at the DataReaderImpl level used to do.

        * tests/DCPS/LargeSample/publisher.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/LargeSample/subscriber.cpp:

          Test requires durability QoS to ensure delivery of all samples
          with rtps_udp transport.  Can't just depend on association_complete
          because the transport will not request resends for lost data with
          sequence numbers less than the first received without durability.
