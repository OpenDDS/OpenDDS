          DDS 0.9 released.

        * VERSION:
        
          Updated for 0.9 release.

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Added release notes for main changes since 0.8.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/RepoIdSetMap.cpp:

          Made demarshal not return error if the repo id is already in the
          map since the subscriber could send the ack for the same repo id
          multiple times.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.cpp:
        
          Fixed a bug that the length of data message block is not
          written to the sample header. This would cause the publisher
          side not deliver the graceful disconnect messages even though
          it received the message from subscriber.
          
        * tests/transport/simple_bp/PubDriver.cpp:

          Removed a logging message.

Mon Jul 17 04:34:47 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/pub.ini:
          
          Updated comments for thread_per_connection.
          
        * tests/transport/dds_comparative/PubDriver.cpp:

        * tests/transport/udp_simple/PubDriver.cpp:
        * tests/transport/udp_simple_n/PubDriver.cpp:

          Added sleep after simulated publisher is initialized so it can wait
          for fully association establishment and then start sending samples.

Fri Jul 14 20:04:19 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.h:
    
          Removed the SimpleTcpConnection.h include to fix the circular dependency
          problem on gcc 3.3.3 builds.

          Modifications required to build DDS with Visual C++ 6.0.  Most of
          the changes involved adding include files and moving inline
          methods into the .cpp's.  The change to the perl module is to
          accommodate vc6's inability to handle calling a base class method
          with an explicit class name.

Sun Jul  3 8:42:38 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        These changes support thread-per-connection send feature. The
        new configuration "thread_per_connection" is added to determine if
        the transport needs create a new thread for a datalink/connection
        to send samples under normal traffic (no backpressure). If
        thread_per_connection is 1, the publisher always creates a seperate
        send thread for each datalink/connection to do the send instead of
        sending to each remote one by one by the same thread.

        * dds/DdsDcps.mpc:

          Added new classes to support thread-per-connection send feature.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.inl:

          Added the new task - ThreadPerConnectionSendTask object to handle
          sending in a seperate thread.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/QueueTaskBase_T.h:

          A simple template ACE task that manages a request queue. The subclass
          provides the function to handle the queued requests.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ThreadPerConnectionSendTask.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ThreadPerConnectionSendTask.h:

          New class to support the thread-per-connection send.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportConfiguration.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportConfiguration.inl:

          Added thread_per_connection configuration.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.h:

          Added DataLink as friend of TransportImpl so DataLink can
          access the private data member configuration object of
          TransportImpl.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:

          Updated to use the new interfaces of the SimpleReconnectTask
          and made the reconnect_task_ allocated on stack instead of
          on heap.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnectionReplaceTask.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnectionReplaceTask.h:

          The new class added to do the connection replacement when
          a new connection is accepted by the passive side.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.cpp:

          Updated to call base class pre_stop_i () first.

          of SimpleTcpReconnectTask.

        * DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/pub.ini:

          Added thread_per_connection configuration.

        These changes fixed the test using simpleUDP. The commit
        "Thu Jun 22 16:06:21 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>" appears
        broke the UDP tests during the full association period.

        * TAO/DDS/dds/DCPS/transport/simpleUDP/SimpleUdpTransport.h:
        * TAO/DDS/dds/DCPS/transport/simpleUDP/SimpleUdpTransport.inl:

          Added new virtual function acked() to check if the acks for
          pending associations are received so the simpleUDP can simply
          always return acked.

        * TAO/DDS/DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/subscriber.cpp:

          Added more sleep period before releasing transport factory. This
          would avoid the error on publisher during shutdown.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.cpp:

          Fixed the transport deadlock upon fully association on Linux. The problem
          is the lock in TransportImpl is recursively aquired.

          Temporary commented the fix for BCB6 build at
          "Fri Jun  9 07:37:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>"
          These changes broke the Linux build.

Thu Jun 22 16:06:21 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        These changes mainly fix the problem
         "create_datawriter() does not wait for full association establishment
         so even if there are waiting subscribers,  a write shortly after
         creating the datawriter may be dropped on the publisher side because
         add_associations() has not completed on the publisher side.
         The sample may also be dropped on the subscriber side because the
         connection exists between the publisher and subscriber but the
         associations have not been mapped on the subscriber side."

         The solution is to make the subscriber send a FULLY_ASSOCIATED ack
         when the new association is received from repo and the connection is
         established. On the publisher side, the transport will notify the
         datawriter that the subscriber is fully associated when the ack is
         received. The application can use get_matched_subscriptions() to
         determine when it should start sending samples.
         (See RT8498 for details)

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportGDControlElement.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportGDControlElement.h:

          Renamed the TransportGDControlElement.* to TransportControlElement.*
          so it can be used for both GRACEFUL_DISCONNECT and FULLY_ASSOCIATED
          messages.

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.h:

          Seperated remote reader handler caching and the listener
          on_publication_matched callback from add_associations(). The new
          method fully_associated() does that part which is called when the
          transport received the FYULLY_ASSOCIATED message from subscriber.

        * dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.cpp:

          Made the publisher not delete the associations after add_publication()
          is done. The associations will be deleted when transport calls the
          full_associated().

          Provided marshal and demarshal method for the associated RepoIds.

        * dds/DCPS/DataSampleHeader.h:

          Added new message id FULLY_ASSOCIATED.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportDefs.h:

          Added Association_Status definition.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.h:

          Added local map to cache the pending association ids,pending
          association data and acked associations.

          Notify the datawriter fully association at an approriated time
          which depend on the timing when pending association is added,
          when ack is received and when the datawriter is registered with
          the TransportImpl. At either time, the pending and ack map will
          be checked to see if any assoications related to a pub id is
          fully associated.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportInterface.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportInterface.h:

          Made add_associations() call add_pending_associations() at
          very last.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportReceiveStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.cpp:

          Handled the FULKLY_ASSOCIATED message.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.h:

          Added method to send the FULKLY_ASSOCIATED messgage.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:

          Added shutdown_ flag to stop the reconnecting during shutdown.
          The shutdown reconnect task call is removed from the connection
          destructor, the shutdown will be called when the connection related
          association is removed or when the transport shutdown. This would
          avoid the destruction order problem of the connection and
          reconnect task objects.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.cpp:

          Made the reconnect task not accept new reuqests when it's already
          shutdown.

        * DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/run_test.pl:

          Changed the using of text file to coordinate between publisher
          and subscriber to use the get_matched_*() function call to determine
          when the publisher can start and finish and when the subscriber
          can finish.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/subscriber.cpp:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/Writer.cpp:

          Used the get_matched_*() function call to determine
          when the publisher can start and finish and when the subscriber
          can finish.

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest3_1/SubDriver.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/FooTest3_2/SubDriver.cpp:

          Made the subscriber sleep for a while before shuttting down the
          transport to avoid the errors due to lost connection during
          shutdown.

        * TAO/DDS/dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy.h:

          Fixed a deadlock situation on linux when the direct_send()
          detects a lost connection and calls the relink(). The problem is the
          direct_send() is called under the lock in send strategy and the
          suspend_send() called by relink() aquires the same lock.
          To fix it, an extra parameter do_suspend is added to relink()
          function to indicate if the relink() needs call suspend_send() on
          send strategy object. If the thread calling relink() already hold
          the lock it will call the operations in suspend_send() before calling
          relink (), otherwise the relink() will call suspend_send().

          Added shutdown () method to SimpleTcpConnection to shutdown the
          reconnect task. This is called during transport pre-shutdown phase
          after the datalink sends graceful disconnect message. This would
          avoid an access violation during transport shutdown.

        * TAO/DDS/dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.cpp:

          Made the shutdown () do shutdown work just once if it's called multiple
          times.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/subscriber.cpp:

          Updated to use servant_to_reference_2().

        * tests/DCPS/MultiDPTest/README:

          Made a corresponding readme.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.h:

          Added the thr_id_ data for checking if the shutdown()
          is called by the thread the task created. The thread
          should not wait for itself. This should fix a potential
          deadlock.

          Changes related to the 0.8 release.

Fri May  5 21:33:33 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Qos_Helper.h:
        * dds/DCPS/Qos_Helper.inl:

          Moved the qos operator functions from TAO::DCPS namespace to global
          namespace. This would resolve the compilation errors on DDS builds
          against DOC's latest version that the VC71 compiler can not find
          the octet sequence operator==.

        * tests/DCPS/BuiltInTopic/main.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/FooTest3_0/PubDriver.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/FooTest4/main.cpp:

          Made the qos operator== called implicitly instead of explicitly.
          Calling operator== explicitly was used as a workarround of the
          compilation problem metioned above.

        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/run_test.pl:

          Added expected lost_subscription_callback=1 to the bp_timeout test.
          This fixed the test failure on windows.

Fri May  5 18:41:51 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * tests/transport/simple/DDS_transport_simple.mpc:
        * tests/transport/simple_bp/DDS_transport_simple_bp.mpc:
        * tests/transport/simple_bp_rm/DDS_transport_simple_bp_rm.mpc:

        * tests/transport/udp_simple/DDS_transport_udp_simple.mpc:
        * tests/transport/udp_simple_n/DDS_transport_udp_simple_n.mpc:

          Added inheritance from portableserver base project.
          This would resolve compilation errors shown on static builds on linux
          platforms.

Fri May  5 17:48:53 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/repo.conf:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/run_test-1p1s.pl:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/run_test-1p4s.pl:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/run_test-2p3s.pl:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/run_test-4p1s.pl:

          Made the repo use the repo.conf to avoid multiple requests
          handled by single orb thread at the same time. This would
          fix the problem on sunos59 gcc3.3.2 builds that the DCPSInfo
          could not be terminated. It seems without using the service
          config file, the DCPSInfo deadlocked and the TerminateWaitKill()
          in perl script will return non-zero which causes the test failure.

Fri May  5 14:44:39 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Updated notes for re-establishment of lost connection.

Thu May  4 20:06:22 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSet_rch.h

          Reversed the changes Scott made on
          "Thu Dec 15  8:35:17 USMST 2005 2005  Scott Harris  <harris_s@ociweb.com>"
          since the TAO1.4a latest version works without the change.

Wed May  3 11:30:09 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * performance-tests/DCPS/SimpleLatency/PubListener.cpp:

          Changed from char* to const char* to avoid build warnings from
          SunCC.

        * tests/DCPS/MultiDPTest/common.h:

          Removed the trailing comma from an enum to avoid build warnings
          from SunCC.

Tue May  2 16:59:07 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Qos_Helper.inl:

          Changed to call operator==(TAO::unbounded_value_sequence<CORBA::Octet>)
          explicitly. It is ugly but it resolves the compilation error on VC71
          against DOC's latest version. This seems be a compiler problem that
          does not recognize the global operator== when the global operator== is
          defined as inline and it's called by the code inside of a namespace.

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:
        * dds/DCPS/SubscriberImpl.cpp:

          Fix bugs on subscriber that does not increase the sequence length
          before adding new elements to the sequence. This problem was detected
          in FooTest4_0 with the DOC's latest version which has the new sequence
          implementation.

Tue May  2 13:38:45 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest3_2/FooTest3_2.mpc:
        * tests/DCPS/FooTest3_1/FooTest3_1NoKey.mpc:
        * tests/DCPS/FooTest3_1/FooTest3_1.mpc:
        * tests/transport/dds_comparative/dds_transport_comparative.mpc:

          Added inheritance from portableserver base project for subscriber.
          This would resolve compilation errors shown on static builds on linux
          platforms.

Mon May  1 13:16:56 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:

          Replaced the close() in SimpleTcpReconnectTask with shutdown ()
          method. The difference is the shutdown() will wait for thread
          exit. This would resolve an access violation due to the race
          condition in the SimpleTcpReconnectTask object
          Some un-necessary variables num_threads_ and active_workers_
          are also removed.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.cpp:

          Made the Datalink not send the GRACEFUL_DISCONNECT message if
          it already received the GRACEFUL_DISCONNECT message from peer.
          This would fix the error
          "SimpleTcpSendStrategy::send_bytes: ERROR: sendv: Bad file
           descriptor iovec count: 3" upon shutdown.

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Fixed a warning with unused variable.

Fri Apr 28 12:59:58 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        These changes fixes a problem on linux that transport does not
        identify peer disconnecting due to crash. This should fix
        the "run_test.pl restart_pub" test on linux.

        * dds/DdsDcps.mpc:

          Added TransportGDControlElement.cpp.

        * dds/DCPS/DataSampleHeader.h:

          Added GRACEFUL_DISCONNECT message id.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.cpp:

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.h:

          Added new hooks so the concrete datalink can send graceful
          disconnect message before transport shutdown or releasing
          datalink.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportGDControlElement.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportGDControlElement.h:

          New type control message that does not need data_delivered
          callback.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportReceiveStrategy.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportReceiveStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.cpp:

          Made the transport also try to reconnect if it did not receive
          the graceful disconnect message when receive_bytes() returns 0.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:

          This is the correct version that Scott committed for fixing
          rae\rt8448\test failure.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:

          Fix a problem were a second disconnect and reconenct did
          not call on_*_disconnected() or on_*_reconnected().
          Yan made the initial fix and I changed it a bit.

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Correct a typo in a log message.

Sun Apr 23 22:50:40 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        These changes are made to an effort to fix rae\rt8448\test failure.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.h:

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleUDP/SimpleUdpSendStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleUDP/SimpleUdpSendStrategy.inl:

          Fixed memory leaks and added more debugging messages.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.inl:

          Fixed multiple reconnected notification problem. The problem
          is the passive connection side seems not realize the lost
          connection before a new connection is reestablished.
          Changed to use the enum reconnect_state_ instead of a bool
          variable to mark various states during reconnecting and also
          seperate the active_reconnect_on_new_association() from
          active_reconnect_i() to make these function more obvious.

Sat Apr 22 21:54:02 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.inl:

          Made the elems_ and queue_ to be allocated on heap. This would help
          resolve a deadlock situation after reconnect fails. The deadlock
          happens when a send thread holds datawriter's lock and try to acquire
          the SendStrategy's lock and the reconnect thread calls terminate_send
          which got the SendStrategy's lock and drop all queued samples and try
          to call data_dropped on DataWriter. The changes makes we can remove
          queued elements outside the SendStrategy's lock.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.inl:

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.cpp:

          Changed to create per connection reconnect task to do the reconnecting instead
          of using single thread to do reconnecting for all datalinks in a TransportImpl.
          Hope this fix the rae\rt8448\test failure

Fri Apr 21 11:42:58 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Added note for a transport limitation.

          Added the new on_*_disconnected and on_*_reconnected to the listener
          implementations.

Fri Apr 21 01:09:00 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        The main changes are made to add the on_*_reconnected and on_*_disconnected
        new callbacks for RT8499.

        * dds/DdsDcpsPublication.idl:
        * dds/DdsDcpsSubscription.idl:

          Added the on_*_reconnected and on_*_disconnected callbacks
          Updated the *LostStatus to just contain the instance handles
          and typedef'd the *LostStatus as *DisconnectedStatus and
          *ReconnectedStatus.

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.h:

          Made the DataReader/DataWriter not cache the *LostStatus and
          added notify_*_diconnected and notify_*_reconnected to support
          the new callbacks.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.inl:

          Updated the notify() function for DISCONNECTED, RECONNECTED and
          LOST connection notification.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.inl:

          On active connection side, made the disconnected callback called
          before reconnect, the reconnceted callback called after reconnect
          succeeded and the lost connection callback called after reconnet
          failed.
          On passive connection side, made the disconnected callback called
          before reconnectschedule the timer, the reconnceted callback called
          when new connection is created and the lost connection callback
          called after the passive_reconnect_duration_ period if not reconnected.
          Updated some methods to correct the reconnect logic on the passive side.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.cpp:

          Changed to use the "old" connection object to transfer its state to
          the "new" connection object instance of using "new" connection object
          copy state from "old" connection object. This was changed since we
          need synchronize the handle_timeout() and transfer state to "new"
          connection object on the "old" connection object.

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.h:

          Updated the data_dropped() method signature to be same as in the base
          class TransportSendListener. This would fix the errors
          "ERROR: Subclass should override if sending control samples. "
          when the transport drops the control messages due to a lost
          connection.

Wed Apr 19 19:13:01 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * bin/dcps_tests.lst:

        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/subscriber.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/Writer.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/run_test.pl:

          Added more options to publisher and subscriber to help automate the
          reconnect tests. Changed run_test.pl to redirect the output to a log
          file so that errors due to an abnormal shutdown and lost connection
          will not show on scoreboard. The final output "test PASSED" or
          "test FAILED" will show the test result.

Wed Apr 19 13:04:26 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest3_0/FooTest3_0.mpc:

          Added inheritance from portableserver base project for subscriber.

        * tests/DCPS/DCPSInfoRepo/DCPSDataReaderI.cpp:

          Added the notify_lost bool parameter to the remove_association()
          method which overrides the virtual methods in
          TAO::DCPS::DataReaderImpl/DataWriterImpl. This should fix the
          test failure on remove_association.

Sun Apr 16 21:43:11 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendListener.cpp:

          Fixed a compilation warning due to an unused variable.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSynchResource.cpp:

          Fixed a bug on wait_to_unclog that passes an ACE_Time_Value::zero
          to handle_write_ready instance of 0 as the timeout parameter.
          This would fix the TCPListener performance test.

          More scoreboard directed cleanup.

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest4/main.cpp:

          This change from std::string to ACE_CString was not dictated by
          the nightly scoreboard, but my local PC failed to compile the
          test as provided with std::string. This is on my home x86-32
          running Linux 2.6.10-1.770_FC2 with gcc version 3.3.3 20040412
          (Red Hat Linux 3.3.3-7). I felt it was not a big deal to add the
          ACE_CString since the test code is already linking in ACE to do
          parameter parsing.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.h:

          Removed extraneous comma from enumeration list. I noticed that
          the enumeration also contains "NOTIFY_IMMEADIATELY" which should
          be changed to "NOTIFY_IMMEDIATELY". I'm not going to change that
          because I don't know the implications of such a change.

Sat Apr 15 13:23:09 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        These changes are tested on linux and fixed the deadlock situation
        during reconnecting.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy.cpp:

          Made the send strategy will not wait for the reconnecting finish
          since the thread might hold the lock in DataWriterImpl and the
          reconnect thread might need call data_dropped () on DataWriterImpl
          which will cause datalock.

Sat Apr 15 11:47:43 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

          These changes are made to expect to fix a deadlock situation during
          reconencting on linux and they also fixed unregister data sample
          errors during shutdown for RT8499.

        * dds/DCPS/WriteDataContainer.cpp:

          Updated the data_dropped() to do same thing as data delivered
          when the transport initiates the data dropping which happens when
          connection lost and reconnet fails.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:

          Made send strategy queue the connection to reconnect task in relink()
          and wait on a condition variable until the reconnect task completes
          the reconnecting and signal the condition. This would resolve the
          deadlock problem on linux and avoid using a recursive lock in
          TransportSendStrategy as a work around in my last commit.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.cpp:

          Added DO_RECONNECT_UPON_SEND case to handle re-establishing
          of a lost connection detected by send strategy.

Thu Apr 13 17:01:08 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.h:

          Changed to use ACE_Recursive_Thread_Mutex to fix the deadlock
          situation during reconnecting on linux. This is a temporary
          workarround. I need find a better way to fix it.

Thu Apr 13 14:59:07 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

Thu Apr 13 12:54:39 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        These are review fix for RT8499 and the compilation errors due to
        data_dropped () and remove_sample() signature changes are also fixed.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.inl:

          Changed to use while loop instead of for loop for code clarity.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.cpp:

          and remove_sample() signature changes.

Thu Apr 13 10:30:47 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        These changs are made to drop messages after the reconnect
        failed for RT8499.

        * dds/DdsDcps.mpc:

          Added RemoveAllVisitor.cpp.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendListener.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendListener.h:

          Added an extra parameter dropped_by_transport bool to the
          data_dropped(), remove_sample() and related methods. The
          dropped_by_transport true indicates the data dropping is initiated
          by transport which occurs when the transport send strategy is in
          a MODE_TERMINATED state. All messages are dropped in that state.
          The dropped_by_transport false which is the case before adding
          this extra parameter. The dropping is a result of remove_sample()
          call which is initiated by datawriter with KEEP_LAST history policy
          when the number of samples exceeds the depth of history queue.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.inl:

          Added a few SendMode types(MODE_TERMINATED, MODE_SUSPEND and
          MODE_NOT_SET). These modes are used when reconnecting logic is
          used. When the connection is lost, the mode is set to
          MODE_SUSPEND until reconnect finishes. In the MODE_SUSPEND state,
          all messages are queued. If the reconnect succeeds, the mode is
          back to the state before suspend. If the reconnect fails after
          a "conn_retry_attempts" attempts, then the mode is set to
          MODE_TERMINATED and all messages in the backpressure queue and
          packet queue are removed and the data_dropped () is called for
          every element. During the state of MODE_TERMINATED, any sending
          or queuing are stopped and the messages are dropped.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.inl:

          Added send_strategy_ data member for state change when reconnecting
          happens. The suspend_send is called before reconnecting. The
          resume_send is called when the reconnect succeeds. The terminate_send
          is called after the reconnect fails.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy_rch.h:

          Removed lost_link() hook. Now we can use the mode in the
          TransportSendStrategy to know the state of the connection.

        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/run_test.pl:

          Fixed the restart_sub test since now we drop the messages
          after reconnect failed.

        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/sub.ini:

          Change to default "conn_retry_attempts".

          to avoid warnings.

Tue Apr 11 10:10:41 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        These changes are made for RT8499 to resolve the problem that publisher
        does not stop sending during reconnecting. There are two parts of the changes
        need be made and note the second part is not done yet.
          1)transport should queue the messages while reconnecting
          2)transport should discard the messages if the reconnect fails.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportReceiveStrategy.cpp:

          Made handle_input () return -1 if the receive_bytes() return -1. This would
          close the connection anyway even it will try to reconnect.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy.inl:

          Added ready_send() virtual function to check if the connection is connected.
          This will be called whenever this->synch_->work_available is called or before
          sendv. This would stop the writing on a disconnected socket.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.inl:

          Made it has reference to the SimpleTcpTransport object and
          added get_transport_impl() accessor.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.inl:

          Made relink() to queue the connection object to the SimpleTcpReconnectTask
          to do the reconnect since we don't want the reactor thread block on reconnecting
          and not receiving other incoming messages.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.h:

          Made this task handle both reconnecting and new connection checking.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.inl:

          Added reconnect task accessor so the SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy can access
          it and handle the connection to the reconnect task to do reconnect.


        These changes are made for RT8499 to add the support to declare connection
        lost upon backpressure timed out.

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Updated comments for "max_output_pause_period" configuration.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportDefs.h:

          Made the wait_on_clogged_resource() and wait_on_unclog() return status.
          The PerConnectionSynch thread terminates if it returns an error.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConfiguration.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConfiguration.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConfiguration.inl:

          Added max_output_pause_period_ and changed the
          conn_retry_backoff_multiplier_ to be float instead of int.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.inl:

          Added new method notify_lost_on_backpressure_timeout() to support
          the disconnecting and notification when the transport stay in
          backpressure too long ( > max_output_pause_period).
          Removed unused parameter "notify" from reconnect_i().
          Accomodated with the changes of conn_retry_backoff_multiplier_
          type change.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.cpp:

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest4/main.cpp:

          Made subscriber attach to transport to avoid the errors return
          from create_datareader() due to no transport.

          try to reconnect in subsequence send/recv failure.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.cpp:

          Added reconnect() call in find_or_create_datalink() method when the
          connection is previously lost and now the datalink is requested because
          of the new association.

          Made the test call attach_transport before create_datawriter()
          to fix the test failures.

Fri Apr  7 00:46:47 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        These files are changed to support the connection reestablishment
        and lost connection notify. See RT8499.

        * dds/DdsDcps.mpc:

          Added new file SimpleTcpReconnectTask.h/.cpp.

        * dds/DdsDcpsDataReaderRemote.idl:
        * dds/DdsDcpsDataWriterRemote.idl:

          Added a paramter "notify_lost" to the remove_association
          in DataReaderRemote and DataWriterRemote interfaces.
          The flag true indicates the remove_association is invoked
          by the InfoRepo after it detected a lost writer/reader. The
          InfoRepo detect the lost writer/reader when the
          add_association/remove_association invocations on the writer/reader
          object reference fail. The datareader/datawriter needs notify the
          the DataReaderListener/DatawriterListener the publication/subscription
          lost.

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.h:

          Added methods to support the notification of the publication/subscription
          lost and updated the remove_associations() signature change.

        * dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/SubscriberImpl.cpp:

          Made the datareader/datawriter register with the TransportImpl upon
          creation and unregister upon deletion.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.h:

          Added notify_lost() method that is called by the SimpleTcpConnection
          upon reconnect failure. Changed the receive_strategy_ to be protected
          data so the SimpleTcpDataLink can access it.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSetMap.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSetMap.h:

          Added lock to protect the map. This would fix the problem when
          multiple add_association() are called at the same time. The
          find_or_create_set() failure causes the add_association() failure.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ReceiveListenerSetMap.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ReceiveListenerSetMap.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/RepoIdSetMap.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/RepoIdSetMap.inl:

          Added internal map accessor so we can iterate the map to notify
          listener about the lost subscriptions/publication.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.h:

          Added methods to register/unregister/find the datareader
          and datawriter object.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportInterface.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportInterface.inl:

          Added TransportImpl object reference accessor.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportReceiveStrategy.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportReceiveStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportReceiveStrategy.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.inl:

          Added relink() funcation and call it when the send_packet()
          and receive_packet() return an error.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConfiguration.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConfiguration.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConfiguration.inl:

          Added new configurations to support connection re-establishment.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.inl:

          This is the main change made for the re-establish a connection.
          Added more states to have enough information for re-establish
          and reuse the connection object. If connector/acceptor role of
          the connection is not changed when the connection is re-established.
          As the connector side, we reuse the same connection object after
          reconnected. As the acceptor side, since the ACE_Acceptor creates
          a new connection each time when it accept a connection, we can not
          reuse the connection object. The states in the "old" connection
          object are copied to the "new" connection object.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.inl:

          Added reconnect() function to replace an "old" connection with the
          "new" connection.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.inl:

          Added method to restart the ReceiveStrategy.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.h:

          This is a new class that is dedicated to check if the incoming
          connections are re-established connection from the remote. This
          would resolve the deadlock problem between the reactor thread
          (calling SimpleTcpTransport::passive_connction()) and the orb
          thread (calling SimpleTcpTransport::make_passive_connction()).
          The reactor thread will enqueue the new connection  to this task
          and let this task dequeue and check the connection.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.inl:

          Called SimpleTcpReconnectTask open and close upon transport
          initialization and shutdown.

          Changed the Listeners to inherit from the POA_TAO::DCPS
          version instead of the the POA_DDS


        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportInterface.h:

          Removed unnecessary friend class declaration.

Wed Mar 29 13:59:23 MST 2006  Trevor Fields  <fields_t@ociweb.com>

        * performance-tests/DCPS/SimpleLatency/SubListener.h:

          Changed the sample_num_ from long to be CORBA::Long to fix
          a warning in fprintf().

Tue Mar 28 14:11:41 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        Added TypeSupport::get_type_name() support for RT8496.

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:
        * bin/DCPS/HTemplate.pm:

          Added *TypeSupportImpl::get_type_name() implementation that use
          the interface repository id as the default type name.
          Made *TypeSupportImpl::register_type() check nil type name. If a nil
          type name is given then the default type_name is used.

        * dds/DdsDcpsTopic.idl:

          Added get_type_name() to the TypeSupport interface.

        * dds/DCPS/Registered_Data_Types.cpp:

          _interface_repository_id() directly.

        * DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/publisher.cpp:
        * DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/subscriber.cpp:

          Updated the example to test TypeSupport::get_type_name() support.
          The nil type name is passed for type registration and get_type_name()

Tue Mar 28 14:19:22 MST 2006  Trevor Fields  <fields_t@ociweb.com>

        * bin/dcps_tests.lst:

          Added TCPListenerTests to the nightly build list of tests to run.
          UDP was not added due to the highly machine dependent performance
          of UDP.


Tue Mar 28 14:09:36 MST 2006  Trevor Fields  <fields_t@ociweb.com>

        Adding scripts for topology tests for RT 8490.

          Fixed compilation after the "using namespace" removal change.

Mon Mar 27 16:14:47 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        These changes are made to fix the DDS test failures between machines
        with different endianess. The swap_bytes configuration value per
        TransportImpl instance is also appropriately used to allow different
        transports use different setting of swap_bytes. (See RT8381)

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:

          Made the Serializer in *DataWriterImpl::marshal() constructed
          with the swap_bytes flag based on swap_byte configuration value
          and made the Serializer in *DataReaderImpl::demarshal() constructed
          with the swap_bytes flag based on the endianess of the host and
          the byte order flag from the publisher.

        * dds/DCPS/DataSampleHeader.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataSampleHeader.inl:

          Set the swap_bytes flag to the Serializer in the reading side based
          on the the endianess of the host and the byte order flag in the data
          sample from publisher.

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Made the sample and control message header correctly set byte_order.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportHeader.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportHeader.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportHeader.inl:

          Added one more octet to the TransportHeader to indicate the endianess
          of the publisher side and updated the marshal and demarshal methods
          with the new flag.

Mon Mar 27 12:06:40 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.h:

          Fixed the compilation error on some platforms in servant_to_reference()
          that misses the "typename" keyword for the_obj variable.

Fri Mar 24 11:22:34 USMST 2006  Scott Harris <harris_s@ociweb.com>

        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/publisher.cpp:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/subscriber.cpp:

          Reduce the template parameters from 3 to 1 for servant_to_reference.
          Thanks to Don Busch for suggesting this.

        * DDS_info.txt:

          More notes from Don's questions.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.inl:

          Moved the TransportReplaceElement cached allocator from PacketRemoveVisitor
          to TransportSendStrategy to fix a bug in the transport. The problem is
          PacketRemoveVisitor is allocated on stack so the allocator is destroyed
          as the PacketRemoveVisitor goes out of scope, but late the
          TransportReplaceElement accesses the allocator and causes the access
          voilation.

        * dds/DCPS/Registered_Data_Types.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/Registered_Data_Types.h:

          Change the hash map using void* as the key to fix the build problem
          on 64bits build.

Tue Mar 14 12:37:29 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Registered_Data_Types.cpp:

          Changed the register_type() to use the_interface_repository_id
          comparison instead of  POA_TAO::DCPS::TypeSupport_ptr comparison.
          This would allow different TypeSupport instances of the same TypeSupport
          type register with the same type name in the same domain pariticipant.
          The second (and subsequent) registrations are ignored.

        * tests/DCPS/MultiDPTest/subscriber.cpp:

          Added a test case that registers different TypeSupport instances of
          the same TypeSupport type using the same type name in a domain
          participant.

        * tests/DCPS/MultiDPTest/subscriber.cpp:

          Added a type to the declaration of 'i'.

Tue Jan 24 13:54:33 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        These changes fixes a bug in Registered_Data_Types that causes
        multiple domain participants within the same domain in a process
        can not register same data types. See RT8440.

        * dds/DCPS/Registered_Data_Types.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/Registered_Data_Types.h:

          Made the DomainHash hash map use DomainParticipant object reference
          as the key instead of domain id. This would allow the data type
          be unique within a DomainParticipant and not within a domain.

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:
        * dds/DCPS/DomainParticipantImpl.cpp:

          Updated the first argument to the
          Registered_Data_Types::register_type() call.

          Created a new test for the bug fix. This is a test to show
          that multiple domain participants within a domain in a process
          can register the same data type.

        * tests/DCPS/unit/MyTypeSupportImpl.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/FooType/FooTypeSupportImpl.cpp:

          Updated the first argument to the
          Registered_Data_Types::register_type() call.

          Changed config parameter from "DCPSBitLookupDurationSec" to
          "DCPSBitLookupDurationMsec" and changed its units to milliseconds.
          Change config parameter from "queue_links_per_pool" to
          "queue_messages_per_pool".
          Changed transport config ""DCPSBitTransportPort" default from
          2841 to 0 so the OS will pick a port and multiple Built-in Topic
          subscribers can run on one machine.
          Fixed a bug where the config parameter "swap_bytes" was being
          read as "swap_byte".

          We were passing a listener impl from the stack to the

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.cpp:

          Add support for -DCPSInfoRepo.  This is identical in action to
          -DCPSInfo (which is essentially deprecated).  I think this is
          more consistent.

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfoRepo.cpp:

        The main changes are adding DDS file configuration feature. The SimpleTcp
        is still a part of DDSDcps library and other concrete transport libraries
        such as SimpleUdp can be dynamically or statically loaded.
        See the projects\DDS\design\configuration_design.txt (from CVS) for
        various scenarios of using dds configurations:

          the TransportImpl object to all DDS tests and made changes on the udp tests
          to allow the SimpleUdp library statically or dynamically loaded.

Fri Jan 13 11:47:29 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * performance-tests/DCPS/SimpleLatency/PubListener.cpp:

          Removed locks before calling TransportInterface::add_pub/sub
          methods to avoid deadlocking.
          Thanks to Don Busch for providing a the StockQuoter example
          that would deadlock if the subscriber started before the publisher.

Wed Jan 04 14:51:42 MST 2006  Trevor Fields  <fields_t@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/Serializer/SerializerTest.cpp:

          that intended to cleanup memory when the write/register fail.
          The changes need more investigation.

Mon Dec 19 09:43:03 MST 2005  Trevor Fields  <fields_t@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.cpp:

          Changed order of code to actually execute code that was

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/PacketRemoveVisitor.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/PacketRemoveVisitor.inl:

          Moved the method back to cpp and removed the ACE_INLINE
          declaration.  The method needed a define in the cpp file.

Fri Dec 16 00:50:26 MST 2005  Trevor Fields  <fields_t@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/PacketRemoveVisitor.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/PacketRemoveVisitor.inl:

          Moved the ACE_INLINE method to the inl file.  Not having it
          in the inl file results in an undefined reference when linking
          with the dll

Thu Dec 15 22:31:13 MST 2005  Trevor Fields  <fields_t@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSet_rch.h:

          Corrected capitalization of header include.

Thu Dec 15 10:08:28 USMST 2005  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSet.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSet.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSet.h:

          Corrected the number of chunks for map_entry_allocator_. It should be
          the number of datalinks. The map_ is also changed to be a pointer of
          hash map so we can appropiately delete the hash map with current
          implementation of ACE_Hash_Map_Manager_Ex and ACE_Hash_Map_With_Allocator.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.inl:

          Made number of chunks in header data block to be 1 instead of 2 since the
          duplicate() increases the ref count of data block.

        * dds/DCPS/Cached_Allocator_With_Overflow_T.h:
        * dds/DCPS/Dynamic_Cached_Allocator_With_Overflow_T.h:

          Added free_to_pool_ count to help debugging.

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Replaced ACE_CHECK with ACE_CHECK_RETURN in some methods with a return
          type.

        * dds/DCPS/WriteDataContainer.cpp:

          Made obtain_buffer() and register_instance() release memory it allocates
          if the methods return error.
          Made the number of chunks for data allocator to be the
          max_samples of resource_limits in qos if that value is not
          LENGTH_UNLIMITED.

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.cpp:

          Fixed a bug in parse_args() that causes crash when passing multiple
          -DCPS options.

          Made write_w_timestamp() release marshalled data sample if write fails.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/UDPListenerTest/DataReaderListener.cpp:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/DataReaderListener.cpp:

          Uncommented the read_samples() which might be accidently checked in previously.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSet_rch.h

          Get the DdsDcps project to build against TAO v 1.4.7.
          Needed to explicitly include the ACE version header so that
          conditional complication that makes DDS build with both the DOC
          and OCI versions of TAO worked.
          Strangely, this is not needed for the latest DOC TAO from CVS
          or when building with gcc/GNUmakefile but is needed for VC71.

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Can not use LONG_MAX for CORBA::Long because on some

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:
        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.h:

          Declared the instance handle collection in DataReaderImpl class
          as ACE_Unbounded_Set instead of std::set. This would fix some
          tests on vc6 build.

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest5/DataReaderListener.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/FooTest5/Writer.cpp:

          Added unused arguments with the template parameter types.
          This is a work arround to fix tests on vc6 builds that failed
          due to the vc6 bug on template function instantiation.

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest3_2/run_test.pl:

          Extended the timeout to fix test.

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest4/Reader.cpp:

Fri Sep 23 15:31:37 2005  Paul Calabrese  <calabrese_p@ociweb.com>

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Add limitation to release notes describing excess memory
          usage of DDS because of application object bufferes being
          oversized.

          Add a new configuration option for Nagle's algorithm
          (TCP_NODELAY).  The default is to disable Nagle's algorithm.
          This was uncovered by some latency testing.  Some
          performance tests with small sample sizes may benefit
          from enabling this algorithm.

Wed Sep  7 08:47:48 2005  Paul Calabrese  <calabrese_p@ociweb.com>

        * bin/all_tests.pl:

          Finally added the all_tests.pl script to the repo.  This
          is a script that automatically runs all the run_*.pl scripts
          it can find under a directory.  It can also loop on the tests
          for a set number of iterations or until a failure is encountered.

Tue Sep  6 11:57:09 2005  Paul Calabrese  <calabrese_p@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DdsDcps.mpc:

          Make sure the Built-In Topic IDL files use the -Gdcps IDL
          compiler option.  This was causing compilation problems with
          SunCC 5.6.

Wed Aug 31 06:39:06 2005  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/BuiltInTopicUtils.h:

          Increase the sample and packet lengths to be 32 bit integers
          so we can support larger samples (greater than 64 KB).

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleUDP/SimpleUdpConfiguration.inl:

          Limit the simple UDP transport to about 64 KB samples
          because of its lack of fragmentation and the MTU.

Tue Aug  2 16:24:58 2005  Paul Calabrese  <calabrese_p@ociweb.com>

Thu Jul 28 13:17:03 USMST 2005  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:

          Fixed memory leak of DataReaderRemote object references.
          - Made the get_dr_obj_ref () assign to a DataReader_var
            since the accessor duplicates object reference count.

        * dds/DCPS/Marked_Default_Qos.cpp:

          Fixed memory leak of DomainParticipantFactory object reference.
          - Made TheParticipantFactory assign to
            DomainParticipantFactory_var since the TheParticipantFactory
            duplicates the object reference count.

        * dds/DCPS/WriteDataContainer.cpp:

          Fixed memory leak of the registered sample data and the
          PublicationInstance object.
          - Made the unregister_all() delete all PublicationInstance
            objects in the instance handle list.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/publisher.cpp:

          Fixed memory leak of the DataWriter object reference.
          - Delete every Writer object after test is done.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/subscriber.cpp:

          Fixed the memory leak of the listener servant.
          - Made the servant assign to PortableServer::ServantBase_var.

Thu Jul 28 10:41:07 MST 2005  Trevor Fields  <fields_t@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataBlockLockPool.cpp:

        * dds/DdsDcps.mpc:
        * dds/DCPS/DataBlockLockPool.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataBlockLockPool.h:

          Created a class to give out ACE_Thread_Mutex lock adapters.
          This just cycles through an array giving out the next lock.
          It does not currently require the returning of the locks.

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:
        * bin/DCPS/HTemplate.pm:

          Changed to use a DataBlockLockPool for providing locks to the
          ACE_Data_Blocks.  The blocks need to be locked to prevent the
          simultaneous access by multiple threads from deforming the
          reference count.

          Added additional code to give more information when the send_bytes
          fails.  This code is marked with "//remove" and
          "DUMP_FOR_PACKET_INFO"

          This code should be removed when the problem has been fixed.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/SimpleE2ETest/Reader.cpp:

          Fixed error with data size.

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest3_0/pub_id.txt:

          Removed test generated file.

Fri Jul 22 08:40:18 MST 2005  Scott Harris <harris_s@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy.cpp:

          Make SimpleTcpSendStrategy::send_bytes log the iovec array when
          sendv returns an unexpected errno in hopes of getting it to
          core when the sendv fails for AAC.  Hopefully this will shed
          some light on the problem.

Thu Jul 21 18:38:54 CDT 2005  Scott Harris <harris_s@ociweb.com>

        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/common.hi:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/subscriber.cpp:

          Added -sd <msec> option to allow the subscriber to sleep for
          <msec> milliseconds for every read call.
          This was added to see what would happend if there was a slow
          subscriber.

        * dds/DCPS/ReceivedDataElementList.inl:

          Corrected comment about why the instance state is not
          deleted in the destructor.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:

          Added delete of queue in destructor.  It was new'd in

          Update and merge the devguide example.  I put it here
          because it proved difficult to integrate into the TAO
          DevGuideExamples directory.

Mon Jul 18 06:43:11 MST 2005  Scott Harris <harris_s@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.h:

          Backed out the change of Thu Jul 14 12:39:15 MST 2005
          because reference_to_servant was fixed in 1.4a_p4.

Sat Jul 16 17:51:05 MST 2005  Scott Harris <harris_s@ociweb.com>

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:

          Make samples replaced in the subscriber's instance queue delete as
          well as free the sample.

        * dds/DCPS/ReceivedDataElementList.inl:

          Added a comment about the ReceivedDataElement destructor
          needing to destroy its InstanceState. But it currently
          causes troubles.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/run_test.pl:

          Change the number of samples from 80,000 to 20,000.

Fri Jul 15 16:01:19 MST 2005  Scott Harris <harris_s@ociweb.com>

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:

          Added Paul C's changes to free read elements in the subscriber
          side instance queue that are being replaced by the recieved
          samples.  It still leaks the if the sample contains a type
          that requires freeing the fields individiually (like sequences).

        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/run_test.pl:

          Changed this test to just have MAX_SAMPLES and
          MAX_SAMPLES_PER_INSTANCE set to the number that will be in
          the instance queue plus some for good measure.
          Previously it would set MAX_SAMPLES and PER_INSTANCE to
          the number of expected samples.

Thu Jul 14 12:39:15 MST 2005  Scott Harris <harris_s@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.h:

          Changed reference_to_servant template to not remove
          a reference to the servant because POA::reference_to_servant
          changed in TAO 1.4a (and 1.4.x) to not increment
          the reference count.

Wed Jul 13 14:03:47 MST 2005  Trevor Fields  <fields_t@ociweb.com>

        * dcps.mpb:
        * dds/DdsDcps.mpc:

Tue Jun 10 18:55:09 UTC 2005  Trevor Fields  <fields_t@ociweb.com>

          Moved files from a branch off of TAO 1.4a to this separate
          repository.
          All files in ACE_wrappers\TAO\orbsvcs\DDS and
                       ACE_wrappers\TAO\orbsvcs\orbsvcs\DDS and
                       ACE_wrappers\bin\DCPS
          were moved over.

          See the ACE_wrappers\TAO\Changeklog_dds_branch
          on the AAC-DDS-1_4_3_branch branch
          in cvs.ociweb.com:/cvs for the original
          developement history.
