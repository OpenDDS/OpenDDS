          handle_protector_ mutex is used for a guard in the pattern of
          other containers in this class.

          Replaced subscriber_handles_ and publisher_handles_ handle

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/Qos_Helper.inl:

          Added support for TIME_BASED_FILTER.
          - Refactored data filtering. data_expired has been renamed
            to filter_sample and a new filter_instance method has been
            added.

Tue Aug 25 21:38:02 UTC 2009  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:

          - According to spec 1.2, Samples that contain no data do not
            count towards the limits imposed by the RESOURCE_LIMITS QoS policy
            so the oldest sample is not removed to impose the resource limit
            requirement when unregister/dispose message arrives.
          - This fixed access violation when trying to add dispose sample
            to instance after instance is released during removing last
            sample.
          - Made DataReader ignore the unregister/dispose message when it does
            not cause state change. This resolved the issue of duplicate
            notifications for unregister or dispose event.

        * dds/DCPS/InstanceState.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/InstanceState.h:

          Made dispose_was_received, unregister_was_received  return a bool value
          to indicate whether it causes instance state change. If it does, the
          unregister or dispose notification sample is added and the listener
          on_data_avaiable is called.

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Moved dispose() call before unregister operation in
          unregister_instance_i() to follow spec 1.2.

        * dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.cpp:

          - Turn on unregister_instance() call in delete_datawriter().
          - Moved persist_data() call before unregister_instance()
            call in delete_datawriter() since unregister_instance()
            causes instance dispose if autodispose_unregistered_instances is
            enabled.

        * dds/DCPS/RakeResults_T.h:
        * dds/DCPS/RakeResults_T.cpp:

          Passed the DataReaderImpl reference to constructor. This solved
          problem that access reader servant via instance crashes after taking
          last sample which probably causes instance release.

        * tests/DCPS/MultiRepoTest/ForwardingListener.cpp:

          Added unregister/dispose notification sample checking and not forward
          unregister/dispose samples.

        * tests/DCPS/NotifyTest/DataReaderListener.h:
        * tests/DCPS/NotifyTest/DataReaderListener.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/NotifyTest/subscriber.cpp:

          - Made the test just count dispose/unregister notification before
            delete_datawriter() call as now the delete_datawriter() will send
            dispose and unregister message to reader.
          - Changed expected unregister event notification to 0 since dispose
            arrives before unregister notification and taking dispose sample
            cause instance dispose so unregister message is ignored.

        * tests/DCPS/Priority/DataReaderListener.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/FooTest5/DataReaderListener.cpp:

          Added unregister/dispose notification sample checking to avoid errors.

          warning.

        * dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.cpp:

          Re-enabled autodispose for scoreboard testing.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportFactory.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportFactory.cpp:

          Removed single argument variant of release; no code uses
          this method and its use can cause dangerous consequences
          (i.e. reactor task referencing invalid data).

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportInterface.h:

          Promoted detach_transport to public scope to match

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.cpp:

          Fixed a problem in transport that possibly creates multiple links
          to same remote. The problem occurs when new association comes while
          the previous link is declared to be released but is in pending release.
          The fix is to keep track the pending released datalinks and reuse the
          datalink if the datalink release is still pending when a new association
          comes.

          This problem is observered in thrash high test with following errors
          on publisher.

          "ERROR: SimpleTcpTransport::passive_connection() - connection with
          oci1176.ociweb.com:39384 at priority 0 already exists, overwriting

          qos was supported now. The default
          autodispose_unregistered_instances is 1 which add dispose
          message upon unregister_instance() call.

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          Made last_publication_handle in liveliness_changed_status
          updated when count is changed. The handle is added to
          WriterInfo and the methods(e.g. writer_become_active,
          writer_become_dead, etc) that changes the status are
          passed with WriterInfo so it can access the handle.

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Supported liveliness lost callback. The liveliness timer
          for AUTOMATIC_LIVELINESS_QOS is also used for liveliness
          lost status update.

Wed Aug 12 16:31:41 UTC 2009  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

          Fixed a bug in handle_input() that did not completely process
          the received data during handle_input in some cases. It returned
          from handle_input whenever there is a message with no data (e.g.
          liveliness message) even there are more data in receiving buffer.
          Since 'amount' is the min value of length of sample data not read
          and the length of left data in receiving buffer, when there is a
          message with no data (e.g.liveliness), the amount is always 0
          so it returns from handle_input. The fix would be return when no
          sample data left and also no data in receiving buffer instead of
          just no sample data left.

          This problem was observed in ManualAssertLiveliness test.

        * tests/DCPS/ManualAssertLiveliness/run_test.pl:

          Updated number of liveliness changed callbacks.

        * tests/DCPS/ManualAssertLiveliness/README:

        * dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.cpp:

          - Added support for WRITER_DATA_LIFECYCLE
          - PublisherImpl::delete_datawriter causes a DataWriter to
            properly unregister all registered instances prior to deletion.

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          Fixed the deadlock situation that the deliver sample thread
          (reactor thread) recursively acquires writers_lock_ read
          lock while there is a waiting writer from add_associations
          thread(orb thread) that acquires write lock. This was achieved
          by allocating WriterInfo on heap and writers_ map maintains
          the WriterInfo pointer so the received_activity() can be moved
          out of the writers_lock_ scope in writer_activity() and the
          WriterInfo internal state can be updated on single copy.

Tue Aug 11 15:30:42 UTC 2009  Steven Stallion  <stallions@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/DestinationOrder/main.cpp:

          - Disabled automatic liveliness assertion for new
            supported liveliness kind.
          - Implemented assert_liveliness() for DomainParticipantImpl
            and DataWriterImpl.
          - Made DataWriterImpl::send_liveliness return status
            code.
          - Fixed the bugs in DataReader and DataWriter that non-zero
            lease duration should be calculated when nanosec is not
            infite as well.

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:

          - Fixed a bug in register_instance() that ACE_GUARD_RETURN
            return nil handle instead of RETCODE_ERROR.
          - Reset the instance handle to nil as return of register_instance()
            if there are any errors encountered during registering.

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:
        * bin/DCPS/HTemplate.pm:
        * bin/DCPS/IDLTemplate.pm:

          Added lookup_instance() to DataWriter and DataReader
          idl and implementations according to spec and removed
          find_instance_handle() which is similar to the
          lookup_instance() function.

        * dds/DCPS/EntityImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/EntityImpl.cpp:

          Added is_enabled() to access enabled_ flag.

        * dds/DCPS/TopicImpl.cpp:

          Code updates according to spec:
          - Calling enable on an already enabled Entity returns OK
            and has no effect.
          - Calling enable on an Entity whose factory is not enabled
            will fail and return PRECONDITION_NOT_MET.
          - Non-changeable qos can be changed prior to calling
            the enable operation on the Entity.
          - Removed enabled_ flag checking in factory delete_*
            operations based on entity enable description that the
            factory operations are allowed when entity is not enabled.

        * tests/DCPS/DcpsIntegration/infrastructure.cpp:

          Updated test as the entity factory autoenable qos are supported
          now and is changeable.

        * tests/DCPS/Deadline/subscriber.cpp:

          Replaced find_instance_handle() call with lookup_instance().

Mon Aug  3 19:18:22 UTC 2009  Steven Stallion  <stallions@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Definitions.h:

          Dropped OpenDDS::DCPS::DEFAULT_STATUS_KIND_MASK in favor of

          - Moved subscription/publication registering with transport to
            writer_enabled() and reader_enabled(). If the reader/writer
            is not enabled, the repo id is invalid so it can not be used
            to register with transport.
          - Made reader_enabled() return status.

        * tests/DCPS/BuiltInTopic/main.cpp:

          Reverted to previous version to not add test cases for

          - Fixed a bug in last commit that did not pass listener mask parameter
            to PublisherImpl constructor.
          - Implemented DomainParticipantFactoryImpl set_qos and get_qos.
          - Made DomainParticipant auto enabled if DomainParticipantFactoryQos
            autoenable_created_entities is 1.
          - Updated DomainParticipant, Publisher, Subscriber, DataWriter,
            DataReader enable() method according to spec:
             "Calling enable on an Entity whose factory is not enabled will fail
              and return PRECONDITION_NOT_MET."
          - Removed code checking enabled_ flag for lookup_* methods. According
            to spec, the lookup can be invoked when an Entity has not yet been
            enabled.

        * tests/DCPS/BuiltInTopic/main.cpp:

          Added unit tests for DomainParticipantFactory set_qos and get_qos

          Main changes:

          1) Constant names changes
             - renamed PUBLICATION_MATCH_STATUS to PUBLICATION_MATCHED_STATUS
             - renamed DURATION_INFINITY_SEC to DURATION_INFINITE_SEC
             - renamed DURATION_INFINITY_NSEC to DURATION_INFINITE_NSEC
             - renamed TIMESTAMP_INVALID_SEC to TIME_INVALID_SEC
             - renamed TIMESTAMP_INVALID_NSEC to TIME_INVALID_NSEC
             - removed TRANSPORTPRIORITY_QOS_POLICY_NAME
             - removed SampleStateSeq
             - removed ViewStateSeq
             - removed OctetSeq

          2) Structure and type names changes
             - Changed BuiltinTopicKey_t from an array to structure of
               an array.
             - Renamed StatusKindMask to StatusMask
             - Renamed SubscriptionMatchStatus to SubscriptionMatchedStatus
             - Renamed PublicationMatchStatus to PublicationMatchedStatus
             - Removed service_cleanup_delay from DurabilityQosPolicy
             - Added autopurge_disposed_samples_delay to
               ReaderDataLifecycleQosPolicy
             - Added ownership to DataReaderQos DataWriterQos,
               PublicationBuiltinTopicData and SubscriptionBuiltinTopicData

          3) Method names changes
             - Renamed on_subscription_match to on_subscription_matched
             - Renamed on_publication_match to on_publication_matched

          4) Method signatures changes
             - Added StatusMask parameter to create entity methods.
               (e.g. create_topic)
             - Changed set_qos, get_qos, get_*_status and assert_liveliness
               to return error code.
             - Uncommented out get_type_name from TypeSupport to be consistent
               with spec. Aded get_type_name() to concrete TypeSupport idl. Used
               _interface_repository_id instead of get_type_name to identify same
               TypeSupport in Registered_Data_Types singleton so get_type_name()
               is not be required to be defined in TypeSupport.
             - Changed subsriber get_datareaders() reader parameter from out to
               inout.

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:
        * dds/DCPS/InstanceState.cpp:

          Adjusted callback ordering by forcing dispose and unregister
          transitions to always pend releases based on non-valid sample
          insertions.

Tue Jul 28 17:50:42 UTC 2009  Steven Stallion  <stallions@ociweb.com>

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:

          Fixed an incorrect ordering of callbacks for dispose/unregister;
          this was causing non-valid data samples to be dropped.

Tue Jul 28 14:17:05 UTC 2009  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * 14a_README:

          Removed this file.  TAO 1.4a is no longer supported.

          Wed Jul 22 21:28:10 UTC 2009  Steven Stallion  <stallions@ociweb.com>
          because it doesn't work when the DataReaderImpl still contains
          samples when it is being deleted.

          Thu Jul 23 19:47:59 UTC 2009  Steven Stallion  <stallions@ociweb.com>
          because it causes crashes (removing from a container while iterating
          over it).  The issue this commit was trying to fix will have to be
          resolved after the 1.3 release.

        * bin/dcps_tests.lst:

          Commenting-out Instance for now.

Thu Jul 23 22:05:39 UTC 2009  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:

Thu Jul 23 17:07:10 UTC 2009  Steven Stallion  <stallions@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/Instance/main.cpp:

          Updates to Instance test (adjusted wait delay for samples);
          improved condition for detecting removed instances.

Thu Jul 23 14:19:02 UTC 2009  Steven Stallion  <stallions@ociweb.com>

        * bin/dcps_tests.lst:

        * tests/DCPS/Thrasher/Thrasher.mpc:

          Renamed the projects to something more specific.

Wed Jul 22 21:28:10 UTC 2009  Steven Stallion  <stallions@ociweb.com>

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Updated release notes with changes to DataWriter::unregister
          and DataWriter::dispose.

        * dds/DCPS/InstanceState.h:
        * dds/DCPS/InstanceState.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/InstanceState.cpp:

          Changes to allow instances to be removed once all samples have
          been removed.

        * java/jms/src/org/opendds/jms/ConsumerMessageFactory.java:
        * java/jms/src/org/opendds/jms/MessageProducerImpl.java:

          JMS will now issue an unregister after writing each Message; this
          prevents a resource leak in DataReaderImpl.

        * tests/DCPS/Instance:
        * tests/DCPS/Instance/Instance.mpc:

Wed Jul 22 19:01:23 UTC 2009  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * Many files

          Removed tabs from all source files (C++, Perl, Java, IDL).

Wed Jul 22 18:19:42 UTC 2009  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.cpp:

          Changed an error message to correctly identify the local
          and remote sides of a failed connection.

Tue Jul 21 22:02:24 UTC 2009  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Preparing for forthcoming 1.3 release and documenting the change
          below:

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:

          Thread priorities are no longer set on Windows systems.  Future work
          in this area may provide a mapping of priority numbers suitable for
          Windows's requirements.

Fri Jul 17 21:46:45 UTC 2009  Steven Stallion  <stallions@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.h:
        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.cpp:

          Updated scheduler quantum to make use of ACE_Time_Value::zero rather
          than a literal; this was confusing some platforms.

Fri Jul 17 17:26:48 UTC 2009  Steven Stallion  <stallions@ociweb.com>

        * java/jms/native/build.xml:

          Simplified creating Debug/Release builds on Windows platforms.

Thu Jul 16 21:03:27 UTC 2009  Steven Stallion  <stallions@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          Adjusted protection in remove_all_associations; fixes failing
          JMS tests.

Thu Jul 16 19:42:46 UTC 2009  Steven Stallion  <stallions@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.cpp:

Thu Jul 16 18:59:22 UTC 2009  Steven Stallion  <stallions@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          Removed uneccessary read lock on writers_map_

Wed Jul 15 23:07:22 UTC 2009  Steven Stallion  <stallions@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.cpp:

          Changed scheduler scope to ACE_SCOPE_THREAD; this should fix
          the ENOTSUP issue on platforms which use pthread_setschedparam.

Wed Jul 15 22:48:37 UTC 2009  Steven Stallion  <stallions@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/Priority/run_test.pl:
        * tests/DCPS/Priority/transport.ini:
        * tests/DCPS/Priority/transport_solaris.ini:

          Updated Priority test to set scheduler quantum on SunOS
          platforms.

Wed Jul 15 22:20:10 UTC 2009  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.h:
        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.cpp:

          Added configurable setting of scheduler quantum values.  This
          is required for SunOS systems which require a non-zero value.

        * tests/DCPS/Priority/transport.ini:

          Add new scheduler_slice key for use on SunOS systems.

Wed Jul 15 19:55:53 UTC 2009  Steven Stallion  <stallions@ociweb.com>

        * MPC/modules/IDL2JNIHelper.pm:
        * MPC/modules/IDLBase.pm:

          Fixed MPC dependency issue in java/tests/complex_idl.

Tue Jul 14 19:41:07 UTC 2009  Steven Stallion  <stallions@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:
        * docs/design/lockmap.txt:

          Added RW mutex to protect writers map in DataReaderImpl instances.
          This fixes a SEGV occasionally seen in Windows XP builds (presumably
          others as well).

Tue Jul 14 16:10:17 UTC 2009  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/Priority/run_test.pl:
        * tests/DCPS/Priority/services.conf:

          Renamed svc.conf to avoid picking it up by default.  This was
          an issue for executing with static builds.

        * tests/DCPS/Priority/svc.conf:

          Removed this file.

Mon Jul 13 20:41:41 UTC 2009  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/WriteDataContainer.cpp:

          Made empty_condition_ wait after holding the lock. This fixed
          the deadlock during shutdown shown in a windows build.

Fri Jul 10 22:09:52 UTC 2009  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/Thrasher/Subscriber.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/Thrasher/run_test.pl:

          Subscriber now knows how many writers to expect and won't shut down
          until that many writers have been seen in SubscriptionMatchStatus.

Fri Jul 10 21:14:42 UTC 2009  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Use the byte order from the sample header, not the setting
          from the publisher's configuration.

Fri Jul 10 20:47:35 UTC 2009  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfoRepo.cpp:

          Re-ordered the headers and removed an unneeded one.

        * DevGuideExamples/DCPS/Messenger/pub.ini:
        * DevGuideExamples/DCPS/Messenger/sub.ini:

          Commented-out the local_address line to let DDS
          discover the local endpoints.

Fri Jul 10 19:28:49 UTC 2009  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/Priority/Publisher.cpp:

          Added calls to wait_for_acknowledgements() after sending all
          data in order to allow the subscriber to receive the data
          before tearing down the connection.

Fri Jul 10 17:25:31 UTC 2009  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataSampleHeader.cpp:

          Changed the pre-parsing of the header to not user the Serializer,
          it's too hard to reset the rd_ptrs if we need to go to the
          continuation block.  Now just manually read the first two bytes and
          leave the rd_ptrs where they are.

Thu Jul  9 22:17:52 UTC 2009  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/WriteDataContainer.cpp:

          Fixed a deadlock situation while datawriter deletion thread
          holds the data container lock and wait for pending data clear
          out and the other thread calls data_delivered on data container
          which acquire the lock as well.

        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/run_test.pl:

          Extended publisher process timeout in case there are more data
          need be clear during shutdown for the bp_timeout test case.

Thu Jul  9 21:56:37 UTC 2009  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest3_1/run_test.pl:
        * tests/DCPS/FooTest3_2/run_test.pl:

          Extend the timeouts for the sake of the slow QNX machine.

Thu Jul  9 18:21:55 UTC 2009  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Noted Windows Mobile and ACE_USES_WCHAR support.

        * MPC/modules/IDL2JNIHelper.pm:

          Fixed Perl syntax error.

        * dds/DCPS/DataSampleHeader.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DataSampleHeader.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportHeader.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportReceiveStrategy.cpp:

          The DataSampleHeader is now variable-length so we need a way for the
          transport to know if it has enough bytes queued up to make a header.
          This should fix the intermittent LivelinessTest failure, and in
          general will make sure that the DCPS layer gets control messages
          (0 bytes of sample data) right away.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/PriorityKey.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/PriorityKey.inl:

          Removed the virtual destructor, this is a value type.

        * DevGuideExamples/DCPS/Messenger/run_ns_test.pl:
        * examples/DCPS/Messenger_Imr/run_test.pl:

          Increase timeouts for running TAO utilities (nsadd, tao_imr).

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest3_0/run_test.pl:

          Typo.

Thu Jul  9 17:47:10 UTC 2009  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/BuiltInTopicTest/monitor.cpp:

          Made monitor 2 wait for monitor 1 finish to avoid fixed time delay
          (15 seconds) may not be enough for monitor 1 get bit data before
          monitor 2 start.

          Renamed opendds_ir_ctl tool to opendds_repo_ctl.

Thu Jul  9 05:16:03 UTC 2009  Steven Stallion  <stallions@ociweb.com>

        * MPC/modules/IDL2JNIHelper.pm:
        * MPC/modules/IDLBase.pm:

          Corrections to the IDL refactoring for Java/idl2jni.

Tue Jul  7 23:49:46 UTC 2009  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/OfferedDeadlineWatchdog.cpp:

          Fixed a bug in the execute() that should not calculate
          the period between two samples if it's called upon first
          sample receiving.

        * tests/DCPS/Deadline/publisher.cpp:

          Adjusted the expected missed deadline calls as the changes
          were made.

        * java/build_scripts/jms_scoreboard.pl:

          Extended the timeout and added a workaround for ant on Windows not
          handling -Dfoo=bar=1 correctly.

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.cpp:

          Fixed for Solaris/x86 with GCC 3.3.2; now using DDS_HAS_WCHAR because
          this platform does indded have ACE_HAS_WCHAR even though its C++ std
          library is incomplete.

        * dds/DCPS/GuidConverter.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.h:
        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.cpp:

          Fixes for platforms without ACE_HAS_WCHAR.  Current support platforms
          with this problem are GCC 3.3.2 on Solaris/x86 and GCC 3.3.5 on QNX.
          The C++ standard library that comes with these compilers is lacking
          std::wstring, std::wostream, etc.

Mon Jun 29 20:38:49 UTC 2009  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

          ACE_TString::find() is a lost cause because the signature varies too
          much between 1.4a and later versions.  Use std::find() instead.

Mon Jun 29 17:53:54 UTC 2009  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

Fri Jun 26 22:28:11 UTC 2009  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        Merged the wchar branch back to trunk.  That branch is now read-only.
        This brings OpenDDS into compliance with ACE uses_wchar=1 builds.  The
        implications of this are described in the file docs/design/wchar.txt
        along with coding guidelines to keep it working.
        The ChangeLog for this branch can be found at history/ChangeLog-wchar.

Thu Apr  9 21:41:50 UTC 2009  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Added removal of subscription ACK sequence storage for readers
          that become unassociated.

        * tests/DCPS/WaitForAck/Options.cpp:

          Demoted a warning message to appear only during debug.

        * tests/DCPS/WaitForAck/Publisher.cpp:

          Updated internal comments.

        * tests/DCPS/WaitForAck/Subscriber.cpp:

          Removed unnecessary QoS values.  Leave history defaulted to
          discard incomming samples.

        * tests/DCPS/WaitForAck/run_test.pl:

          Added the script.

Wed Apr  8 21:59:22 UTC 2009  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          wait_for_acknowledgments() - modified to perform check for
            previous ACK values before waiting.  This covers the case
            where previous wait calls have been made and the received ACK
            value is sufficient to not block the caller.

        * tests/DCPS/WaitForAck:
        * bin/dcps_tests.lst:

          Added regression test.

Wed Apr  8 15:42:27 UTC 2009  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:

          Demoted error message in destructor to warning to allow tests
          to pass which are not cleaning up entirely.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/SendResponseListener.cpp:

          Include precompiled headers.

Wed Apr  8 01:30:15 UTC 2009  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          WriterInfo::last_sequence() - accessor and mutator added to
            store that actual last observed sequence value.
          WriterInfo::clear_acks() - factored out the removal of requests
            from the storage to allow processing to occur via different
            mechanisms.
          WriterInfo::should_ack() - refactored removal of stored
            requests to clear_acks(); makes comparison with stored last
            observed sequence value rather than requiring it as an
            argument.
          DataReaderImpl::send_sample_ack() - indicated success of
            response generation with return value; simplified header
            argument to add two explicit arguments with a sequence value
            to ack and the publication to which the ack should be
            directed.
          DataReaderImpl::add_associations() - added check for any ack
            requests on association establishment and send the response
            if appropriate.
          DataReaderImpl::data_received() - modify ack response
            generation to be dual staged, setting the observed value
            before the check and clearing the stored ack only on sending
            of a successful response.  Added some more diagnostics.

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Changed sequence numbering to preincrement so that the first
          sequence number will be larger than the initial value of the
          type and the member value will always contain the value that
          was included with the last sent message.  Cleaned up some
          diagnostic messages.  Added some more.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:

          Added a diagnostic message to destructor to note if the
          containers are not empty.  Removed annoying code review comment
          from 1Q05.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSetMap.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSetMap.cpp:

          dump() - diagnostic aid.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/SendResponseListener.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/SendResponseListener.cpp:

          Refactored to include a cpp file for the virtual function
          implementations.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportInterface.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportInterface.inl:

          send_response() - return indication of response sending status;
            demoted error message to a warning and added a dump of the
            link map with the warning message.  Removed an annoying code
            review comment from 1Q05.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSet.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportInterface.cpp:

          Removed annoying code review comments from 1Q05.

        * tests/DCPS/Thrasher/Subscriber.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/Thrasher/run_test.pl:

          Extended diagnostic capabilities: made individual return codes
          distinguishable and reported mismatched expected results;
          added the ability to examine the generated command lines
          without needing to execute them.

Tue Apr  7 18:29:38 UTC 2009  Steven Stallion  <stallions@ociweb.com>

        * java/jms/README:

          Added requested documentation on internally used QoS policies and
          ParticipantFactoryService restrictions.

        * java/jms/src/org/opendds/jms/management/argument/DCPSArguments.java:

          Added support for -DCPSPendingTimeout.

Tue Apr  7 16:55:59 UTC 2009  Steven Stallion  <stallions@ociweb.com>

        * java/jms/src/org/opendds/jms/DataWriterPair.java:

          Added support for wait_for_acknowledgments.  This should
          resolve the remainder of failing JMS compat tests due to
          timing issues.  By default, the timeout is configured at
          30 seconds.

Tue Apr  7 16:05:36 UTC 2009  Steven Stallion  <stallions@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/GuidConverter.h:

          Dropped comment; behavior is consistent with Section 12.2.5
          of n2798=08-0308 (per Adam Mitz).

Tue Apr  7 15:47:11 UTC 2009  Steven Stallion  <stallions@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendListener.h:

          Correct forward declaration.

        * tests/DCPS/Thrasher/ParticipantTask.cpp:

          Add call to wait_for_acknowledgments() before shutting down.

Mon Apr  6 21:28:25 UTC 2009  Steven Stallion  <stallions@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/GuidConverter.h:

          Changed const ref member to value; fixes broken GCC 3.x
          and some VC++ compiler behavior.  This fixes the remainder
          of failing BuiltinTopic tests.

Fri Apr  3 21:34:54 UTC 2009  Steven Stallion  <stallions@ociweb.com>

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

Thu Apr  2 21:16:18 UTC 2009  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          data_received()   - added check and call to send SAMPLE_ACK
                              message when needed to SAMPLE_DATA
                              handling.  Added stanza for handling
                              received REQUEST_ACK messages.
          send_sample_ack() - stub for implementing the creation and
                              sending of the SAMPLE_ACK message.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:

          Added a mapping of publication Id values to
          TransportSendListeners for calling back with SAMPLE_ACK
          messages.

          make_reservation() - added TransportSendListener parameter.
                               Add the listener to the listener map.

          ack_received() - finished implementation to call back listener
                           for the publication identified by the
                           SAMPLE_ACK message.

                               link->reserve_datalink() call.

          add_subscriptions() - added TransportSendListener parameter
                                that is forwarded to add_associations().

          add_publications() - forward nil TransportSendListener parameter
                               to add_associations().

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendListener.h:

        * dds/DCPS/DataSampleHeader.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DataSampleHeader.cpp:

          Added new MessageId values for REQUEST_ACK and SAMPLE_ACK.
          Change serialization of publication Id field to use generated
          type support instead of using a memcpy.

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Added wfaLock_ and wfaCondition to manage blocking in the
          wait_for_acknowledgments() method.  Added idToSequence mapping
          to track recieved acknowledgments.

        * dds/DCPS/Definitions.h:

          Corrected SequenceNumber implementation.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:

          ack_received() - added to receive SAMPLE_ACK messages.  Started
                           initial implementation.  This is currently
                           stubbed and does not actually forward the
                           messages to the DataWriter.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.cpp:

          deliver_sample() - added clause to forward SAMPLE_ACK messages

          Made the get_id() and get_*_id () to return reference instead
          of value so the GuidConverter constructed with a valid guid
          reference instead of temporary memory which may be overwritten.
          This resolved BuiltInTopic test failure due to bogus key value
          from builtin topic data.

          Refactored uses of GuidConverter to RepoIdConverter.  Prepared
          codebase for InstanceHandle_t refactoring (i.e. removed
          conflicting conversion operators).  RepoId should now be treated
          as an opaque type.

        * DevGuideExamples/DCPS/Messenger/Messenger.mpc:
        * DevGuideExamples/DCPS/Messenger/stack_subscriber.cpp:

          Reworked this example as the entire premise before was

          any reference-counted object should be usable on the
          stack if the reference count is managed properly.

          some other behavior that pre-dates the conversion to local
          objects.  Also removed some related dead code (#ifdef-ed out).

Fri Mar  6 16:48:35 UTC 2009  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Distributed/src/DataReaderListener.cpp:

          Measure round trip time from application layer timestamp
          carried in the data sample.  This had been using the hop
          generated source_timestamp.

          Added intermediate subscribers to originating process in order
          to collect more round trip data.  Changed data collection files
          to use ".data" as an extension rather than "_data" as part of
          the filename.

Fri Mar  6 02:55:31 UTC 2009  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Distributed/src/DataReaderListener.cpp:

          Force decimal format for size reports.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Distributed/src/Process.h:

          Change mutex type to ACE_SYNCH_MUTEX to avoid platform
          dependent problem with wait() call.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Distributed/src/Process.cpp:

          Extend diagnostic messaging around the test duration
          processing.

Thu Mar  5 21:03:12 UTC 2009  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Distributed/src/Process.h:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/Distributed/src/Process.cpp:

          Added GuardCondition and termination flag to aid in managing
          test control using signals.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Distributed/src/Publication.cpp:

          Added diagnostic information and manage message count for
          forwarding in addition to generated messages.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Distributed/tests/s1-h1-p1.ini:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/Distributed/tests/s1-h2-p1.ini:

Wed Mar  4 23:45:06 UTC 2009  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Distributed/src/Process.h:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/Distributed/src/Process.cpp:

          Added an ACE_Condition to use for causing the main thread to
          wait during test execution.  This allows a signal handler to
          signal this condition to gracefully unblock the process and
          allow data to be gathered after this event.  Added the
          unblock() method for supporting this as well.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Distributed/src/TestProcess.mpc:

          Made the test process a svc_util to bring in the TAO
          Shutdown_Functor support used for signal handling.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Distributed/src/Shutdown.h:

          Local implementation of Shutdown_Functor signal handling
          actions.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Distributed/src/testprocess.cpp:

          Instantiate the signal handling object to catch signals and
          shutdown the main processing thread gracefully.

Wed Mar  4 04:40:37 UTC 2009  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Distributed/bin/run_test:

          Changed mechanism to add to the library path since the module
          add_lib_path was not exporting adequately for the subprocess to
          access the updated values.  Modified scenario specification to
          be a list of files with each file corresponding to starting a
          testprocess executable to process it.  Minor cleanup of a
          command line argument collision.

          Added new scenario definitions and configuration files.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Distributed/tools/mkpkg:

          Changed copy targets to be directory only.  Changed from old
          scenarios to new scenarios.

          Modified test to work portably for null case.

Fri Feb 27 16:19:31 UTC 2009  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Distributed/src/Publication.cpp:

          Convert to long *after* scaling.  This eliminates a compiler

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.cpp:

          Removed a .in().  In this case we need the _var, not the _ptr.
          This resolves a compiler error on SunCC.

Fri Feb 20 15:08:32 UTC 2009  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * java/jms/README:

Mon Feb 16 22:16:27 UTC 2009  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          Started annotating some routines to help understand what the
          desired behavior is.  Increased the debug level at which some
          diagnostic messages are produced.  Demoted an error message
          to a diagnostic message and resume processing rather than
          terminating it.

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.h:
        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.cpp:

          Added a lock to be used for guarding access to internal maps.
          Changed the init_bit_transport_impl() method to be by domain
          rather than repository key.  Changed the RepoTransportMap to be
          keyed by domain rather than repository key.  Guarded internal
          map accesses using the new lock.

        * tests/DCPS/Thrasher/Subscriber.cpp:

          Added a delay to account for a known reception issue at test
          termination time.

        * tests/DCPS/Thrasher/run_test.pl:

          Added some diagnostics and (commented) additional diagnostic
          parameter specifications.

          Fixed warnings and compile errors with TAO 1.4a (ACE_String_Base
          has no empty() method, use length().)

        * tests/DCPS/Thrasher/run_test.pl:

          Perl scripts should not reference LD_LIBRARY_PATH directly.
          Changed to use the helper function for adding to the runtime path.

          Added this as the test process implementation including all
          participants, topics, publications and subscriptions in the
          configuration specification.  This is currently stubbed.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Distributed/src/Publisher.cpp:

          Stubbed these until the configuration implementation is
          complete.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Distributed/src/TestProcess.mpc:

          Updated with new and removed files.

        * dds/DCPS/WriteDataContainer.cpp:

          Changed delete_datawriter behavior to wait for pending samples
          to drain before removing associations.  The timeout may be
          controlled with the -DCPSPendingTimeout which takes an interval
          in seconds as its argument.

Wed Feb 11 20:13:01 UTC 2009  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Distributed:

          Added new test directory to hold distributed testing support.
          Initially this will be used to support RT12484.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Priority/Commas.h:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/Priority/Commas.cpp:

        * dds/DCPS/SubscriberImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/SubscriberImpl.cpp:

          Added the ability to configure the Latency data collection
          parameters via the subscriber.  This avoids a race between
          configuring the readers and establishment of associations.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Priority/Subscriber.cpp:

          Use the new Subscriber scope data collection configuration
          mechansim.

Fri Feb  6 20:46:42 UTC 2009  Steven Stallion  <stallions@ociweb.com>

          New data collection implementation.

        * dds/DCPS/Stats_T.h:

          Added data collection implementation as a base class.  Moved
          this to within the OpenDDS::DCPS namespace.

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          Added configuration of data collection implementation and
          exposed the statistical information via C++ interface to allow
          gathering raw latency data.  Defaults all result in no data
          being collected, so there should be no impact to code that does
          not explicitly enable the feature.

          output when requested.

        * tests/DCPS/Priority/Options.h:

          Moved includes before the conditional use of 'pragma once'
          to avoid compiler complaints.

Wed Feb  4 00:04:09 UTC 2009  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

          Migrated behaviors for Communication Status entities to conform
          to specification version 1.2 (formal/07-01-01).  This included
          member name changes to LivelinessChangedStatus, modifying and
          extending the SampleRejectedStatusKind enumeration and adding
          members to the PublicationMatchStatus and SubscriptionMatchStatus
          structures.

          Listener lifetime management as well as use of the updated
          Communication Status entities.  Commas was added as a
          formatting abstraction for test results output.

        * java/tests/complex_idl/ComplexIDLTest.java:

          on_publication_match() is now also called when the association
          goes away.  Updated the test to check for this.

Fri Jan 30 15:21:26 UTC 2009  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Priority/Priority.mpc:

          Corrected the "after +=" to refer to projects in this file.

Fri Jan 30 03:56:16 UTC 2009  Steven Stallion  <stallions@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Fixed SEGV in remove_all_associations.

Thu Jan 29 22:42:32 UTC 2009  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * java/dds/dcps_java.mpc:

          Due to yesterday's change to dds/DdsDcpsSubscriptionExt.idl,
          the file DdsDcpsGuid.idl needs to also be visible to Java apps.

        * java/idl2jni/codegen/im_java.cpp:

          Fixed a bug in IDL octet constants (Java bytes).

        * java/idl2jni/codegen/im_jni.cpp:

          Use pass-by-reference for C++ arrays so that they don't decay
          to pointers.  This will support the arrays in DdsDcpsGuid.idl but
          not the general case of multiple IDL array typedefs for the same
          element type and size.

Thu Jan 29 17:54:16 UTC 2009  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Priority/Publisher.cpp:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/Priority/Test.h:

          Switched to using PUBLICATION/SUBCRIPTION_MATCH_STATUS for test
          synchronization and using LocalObject<>_var lifetime management
          for the reader listener.  Limited to a single publisher process
          with 2 publications.

Thu Jan 29 05:35:56 UTC 2009  Steven Stallion  <stallions@ociweb.com>

        * java/jms/build.properties:
        * java/jms/build.xml:

          Removed source compatibility flags; causes unpredictable behavior
          when used with JDK 1.6 compilers (reported against 1.6.0_11).

Wed Jan 28 23:05:39 UTC 2009  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Priority/DataReaderListener.h:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/Priority/DataReaderListener.cpp:

          Added ability to conditionally compile in zero copy take in
          place of take_next_sample calls.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Priority/Publisher.cpp:

          Unconditionally print a summary of test messages at end.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Priority/Subscriber.cpp:

          Modified to use the new 'publication' attribute type in the
          LatencyStatistics structure.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Priority/run_test.pl:

          Removed delay from test execution.

Wed Jan 28 22:57:01 UTC 2009  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DdsDcpsSubscriptionExt.idl:

          Modified the publication attribute of the LatencyStatistics
          structure to be of GUID_t type.  This is more useful as the
          lifetime of the previous InstanceHandle_t type expired prior to
          the statistics being gathered in common scenarios.

Tue Jan 27 23:00:47 UTC 2009  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * bin/dcps_ts.pl:

          Changed how the input idl file is #included by the generated idl
          file so that all generated files can be kept in a spearate
          directory from the source files.  If the source file is in a
          subdirectory "src" then -Isrc needs to be passed to tao_idl when
          it compiles the generated idl file.  Thanks to Brad Howes
          <howes at ll dot mit dot edu> for his mailing list post that
          motivated this change.

Tue Jan 27 22:29:55 UTC 2009  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/Compiler/idl_test3_lib/FooDef.idl:

          Reverted Fri Jan 23 17:05:16 UTC 2009  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>
          because the tao_idl compiler in the DOC repository has been fixed.

Tue Jan 27 00:18:06 UTC 2009  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * dds/InfoRepo/Federator.idl:
        * dds/InfoRepo/FederatorManagerImpl_updates.cpp:

          Added the 'publication_transport_priority' attribute to the
          PublicationUpdate structure explicitly since it does not nest
          the actual data type.

          value as well.

          Modified the association state gathering to account for the
          fully implemented PUBLICATION/SUBSCRIPTION_MATCH
          StatusConditions.

Mon Jan 26 21:01:53 UTC 2009  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/LivelinessTest/subscriber.cpp:

          Expanded the test failure message to be useful.  Relocated the
          test status determination to occur prior to shutting down the
          service and added a gratuitous delay in lieu of synchronization
          at the end of the test.
          TODO: Rewrite this test to use StatusConditions for test
                synchronization rather than files and delays.

          These tests explicitly set the TransportInterfaceInfo structure
          within an internal AssociationData sequence to substitute the
          actions of the repository.  These need to set the newly added
          publication_transport_priority field as well.

Fri Jan 23 17:05:16 UTC 2009  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/Compiler/idl_test3_lib/FooDef.idl:

          In the DOC codebase, the tao_idl compiler has recently changed
          its handling of bounded strings (bug 3524) and the DCPS custom
          serialization is not compatible with this yet.  For now we'll make
          these test strings unbounded.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:

          Moved operator<<(ostream&, const DataLink&) to the global namespace.
          It would be nicer in the same namespace but Visual C++ and many
          versions of GCC are confused by the mix of overloaded operators in
          the global namespace and OpenDDS::DCPS.

        * java/dds/dcps_java_optional.mpb:

          Removed trailing whitespace.

        * dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.cpp:

          Added reverse_pi_lock_ to fix some deadlock situations that
          threads acquire locks(PublisherImpl pi_lock_, TransportInterface
          reservation_lock and TransportImpl lock_) in reverse order.

          Removed this file.

Wed Jan 21 04:48:42 UTC 2009  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DdsDcpsInfoUtils.idl:

          Added publication_transport_priority field to
          TransportInterfaceInfo structure.

        * dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.cpp:

          Assign TransportInterfaceInfo.publication_transport_priority
          value from the DataWriterQos::transport_priority value.

        * dds/DCPS/SubscriberImpl.cpp:

          Default TransportInterfaceInfo.publication_transport_priority
          value to 0.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportInterface.cpp:

          Add new TransportInterafaceInfo.publication_transport_priority
          value from association data as priority for subscription when
          calling reserve_datalink() for new publications.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:

          Extended/corrected diagnostic messagse.  Removed stale code
          review comments from 1Q5.  Extend the initial handshake data to
          include sending and receiving the publication transport
          priority.  Store the received transport_priority value when
          accepting new connections.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.cpp:

          Extended diagnostic messages.  Changed the connections mapping
          to be keyed with a PriorityKey type and modified to use an STL
          map.  Use the connection transport_priority value for the key
          when accepting new connections.  This will be derived from the
          additional initial handshake data.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.cpp:

          Added new diagnostic message.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:

          Added new diagnostic messages.  Added insertion operator onto
          std::ostream to produce formatted diagnostic data about current
          link utilization.

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          Factored statistics gathering behavior into a separate object
          type and maintain a separate map of statistics values that
          persists beyond the lifetime of the writers for which the
          statistics are gathered.

Fri Jan 16 22:37:23 UTC 2009  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.cpp:

          release ordering issues.

Fri Jan 16 04:14:06 UTC 2009  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * DDS_release_notes.txt

          Updated with SUBSCRIPTION/PUBLICATION_MATCH_STATUS
          implementation changes.

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          Added diagnostic in destructor to notify of any remaining data.
          Implement SUBSCRIPTION_MATCH_STATUS processing to reduce the
          total_count when remove_associations is called.

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Implement PUBLICATION_MATCH_STATUS processing to reduce the
          total_count when remove_associations() is called.

        * dds/DCPS/WaitSet.h:
        * dds/DCPS/WaitSet.cpp:

          detach_conditions() - new convenience method to allow detaching
                                multiple conditions using one call.
          detach_i() - factored detach processing for use by single and
                       multiple interface methods.

        * dds/DCPS/WriteDataContainer.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportReceiveStrategy.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:

          Added diagnostics in destructors to notify when there is data
          that has not been sent downstream.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Priority/Publisher.h:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/Priority/Publisher.cpp:

          Obsoleted the writer and status members.  These are no longer
          necessary since each Writer will now contribute a status
          condition to the wait set.  Change the startup synchronization
          to wait for each Writer to have a subscription matched before
          starting to publish from any Writer.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Priority/Subscriber.cpp:

          Changed from using the LIVELINESS_CHANGED_STATUS to using
          SUBSCRIPTION_MATCH_STATUS and terminating the subscriber once
          there are no more subscriptions.

Thu Jan 15 22:52:38 UTC 2009  Steven Stallion  <stallions@ociweb.com>

        * java/dds/dcps_java.mpc:

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          Increased debug level for an annoying cached data diagnostic
          message from 5 to 8.

        * dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.cpp:

          Added a diagnostic message identifying the number of
          subscriptions added to individual publications during
          add_associations processing.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/ReliableMulticast/ReliableMulticastDataLink.cpp:

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/PerConnectionSynch.cpp:

          Renamed the priority member to dds_priority_ to avoid any
          potential conflict with base class members.  Added a diagnostic
          message during thread activation.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ThreadPerConnectionSendTask.cpp:

          Modified to map transport_priority instead of (possibly base
          class) priority value.  Added a diagnostic message during
          thread activation.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.inl:

          avoid potential conflicts with base class elements.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.cpp:

          Added priority to constructor arguments for data link.  Form
          PriorityKey value using explicit transport_priority value.
          Extended diagnostic messages.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleUnreliableDgram/SimpleUnreliableDgramDataLink.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleUnreliableDgram/SimpleUnreliableDgramDataLink.inl:

          Added priority to constructor arguments and passed this value
          to the base class DataLink constructor.  Removed the local
          priority member and method, using the base class values
          instead.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Priority/DataReaderListener.h:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/Priority/DataReaderListener.cpp:

          Turn off per message verbosity.  Add total_message and
          valid_message counter interfaces and management.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Priority/Publisher.cpp:

          Added information about writer priority to diagnostic message
          during creation.  Correct _var access idiom.  Added number of
          subscriptions to diagnostic message at start of publication.
          Added total sent messages summary at end of publication.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Priority/Subscriber.h:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/Priority/Subscriber.cpp:

          Expose listener total and valid messages interfaces from this
          class.  Change shutdown criteria to be lack of *any* attached
          publications and extend diagnostic message with related
          information.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Priority/Writer.h:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/Priority/Writer.cpp:

          Add sent message count interface and management.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Priority/publisher_main.cpp:

          Change verbosity from DCPS to local command line argument.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Priority/subscriber_main.cpp:

          Add total and valid message information to the result summary.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/InfoRepo_population/InfoRepo_population.mpc:

          Added the coverage base project to syncServer, it didn't have it
          automatically because it's a TAO-only project (no DDS base projects).

Tue Jan  6 17:47:49 UTC 2009  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:
        * bin/DCPS/HTemplate.pm:

          Made arg passed to get_instance_handle() to be const reference.

Tue Jan  6 16:02:59 UTC 2009  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * bin/DCPS/HTemplate.pm:

          Removed a spurious scope specification from the
          get_instance_handle() method implementation.

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          Added specification compliance change from RT12617 as code in
          this area has been changing and had nullified the patch added
          to that ticket.

Mon Jan  5 21:24:56 UTC 2009  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/ReliableMulticast/ReliableMulticastTransportImpl.cpp:

          Fixed datalink reference counting bug in find_or_create_datalink().
          The problem can be reproduced if subscriber process creates two
          datareaders use same transport and associates with same datawriter.

Mon Jan  5 20:45:31 UTC 2009  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        Fixed deadline implementation bugs (See RT12629).

        * dds/DCPS/WriteDataContainer.cpp:

          1)Made the deadline violations reported on a per-instance
            basis instead of per Writer/Reader basis to be consistent
            with DDS specification.
          2)Added code to update for last_instance_handle field of the
            deadline status.
          3)Fixed bug that Deadline QOS is not changeable in the case
            where a deadline was not initially specified.
          4)Still used the fixed interval and require at least one sample
            per interval, but made Deadline Watchdogs detect the deadline
            missed if two samples are sent/received in two seperate deadline
            interval but period between two samples is greater than missed
            deadline interval.
          5)To avoid overhead of timer cancellation and rescheduling upon
            each sample receiving/sending. The DataReader and DataWriter
            instance record the time of last sample and current sample.
            The watchdog will check missed deadline either when timer expires
            or when a sample is received/sent. The timer is scheduled initially
            upon new instance registration and is reschedule only in 4) case.

Sat Dec  6 22:56:15 UTC 2008  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/FileSystemStorage.h:

          ACE 5.4a doesn't define ACE_DIRENT so define it here based on the
          ACE version.

Sat Dec  6 20:59:16 UTC 2008  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/FileSystemStorage.cpp:

Fri Dec  5 23:23:24 UTC 2008  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        Merged the JMS_PROVIDER branch (r1812) back to the trunk.
        That branch is now only for archival purposes.  Its ChangeLog
        is now in the file $DDS_ROOT/history/ChangeLog-JMS_PROVIDER.

        This changeset includes many improvements to the core OpenDDS
        libraries as well as the incorporation of a JMS Provider based on
        OpenDDS (located at $DDS_ROOT/java/jms).  Subsequent commits to the
        release notes will detail all of the user-visible changes to OpenDDS.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.cpp:

          Add attach() member functions to attach publishers
          and subscribers to the transport implementation.
          This helps users avoid downcasting to the publisher
          and subscriber implementations.

          machines that add_associations is not performed because
          of deleting.

Thu Oct 30 17:00:49 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

          and notify_status_condition()).

        * dds/DCPS/EntityImpl.cpp:

          Fixed a warning.

Wed Oct 29 23:53:35 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/EntityImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/EntityImpl.cpp:

          Added lock to protect the status_changes_.

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Removed lock in get_status_changes() and
          notify_status_condition() as the status
          change is protected by EntityImpl lock. This
          should resolve potential deadlock when two threads
          acquire WaitSet lock and DataWriter/DataReader lock
          in reverse order.

Wed Oct 29 20:48:24 UTC 2008  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * bin/dcps_tests.lst:

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:

          Made disconnect() to unregister connection with reactor.
          This would avoid access violation if reactor cleanup
          handles after connection is destroyed.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy.cpp:

          Made relink() check if connection is nil to avoid access
          violation when trying to reconnect while datalink is
          releasing.

          view the entire documentation.  This replaces the earlier text
          file design documentation.

Wed Oct 29 18:18:29 UTC 2008  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * DDS_TAO.mwc:

          Added PI and CodecFactory.  They're not strictly needed but TAO will
          try to load them at runtime and it will produce a confusing error
          message (which is flagged as an error on the scoreboard).

Wed Oct 29 17:41:05 UTC 2008  Ciju John  <johnc at ociweb dot com>

        * java/tests/dcps_java_tests.lst:
        * java/tests/messenger/run_test.pl:

          simultaneously.

Tue Oct 28 21:34:20 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          Overloaded notify_status_condition() to get sample_lock_
          before calling base class notify_status_condition(). This
          should resolve deadlock situation that two threads (
          one calling notify_status_condition() and another calling
          data_received()) acquire DataReaderImpl sample_lock_ and
          ConditionImpl lock_ reversely.

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Similar change as DataReaderImpl.

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfo_i.cpp:

          Corrected conn_retry_attempts_ setting which should be set 0
          even the local_address is not configured.

        * DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:

          Added guard for accessing sub_map_ and pub_map_ in exist()
          function.

        * tests/DCPS/sub_init_loop/publisher.cpp:

          Changed history qos to be default(KEEP_LAST_HISTORY_QOS)
          instead of KEEP_ALL_HISTORY_QOS as it's not required.
          This avoids publisher continue consume resouce after
          subscriber encounter deadlock.

Mon Oct 27 20:59:57 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.cpp:

          Fixed a bug in add_pending_association() that
          check_fully_association by individual association does not
          remove the fully associated pair in the pending list so
          fully_associated may be called multiple times for the same
          association.

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfo_i.cpp:

          Configured BIT transport to not attempt connect after lost
          connection. This would avoid reconnect errors during repo
          shutdown.

Mon Oct 27 15:09:34 UTC 2008  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/GuardCondition/GuardConditionTest.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/StatusCondition/StatusConditionTest.cpp:

          Changed mechanism used for waiting for threads to terminate, the
          old way was hanging on some linux systems (rome).

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Updated release notes with DCPSInfoRepo changes.

Mon Oct 20 18:03:31 UTC 2008  Steven Stallion  <stallions@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.cpp:
        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfoRepo.cpp:

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfoRepoServ.cpp:
        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfo_i.cpp:

          DCPSInfoRepo refactorings:

          - DCPSInfoRepo will no longer abort on an invalid Transport
            configuration.
          - Added catch all to DCPSInfoRepoServ::init to ensure
            failed initialization cleans up state correctly.
          - Cleaned up DCPSInfoRepoServ interfaces (i.e. unused return
            values, incorrect return types).
          - Usage will no longer call ACE_OS::exit; now throws an
            InitError instead.
          - Service_Participant::shutdown is now resilient; assertion
            replaced with conditional if CORBA::ORB is nil.

Fri Oct 17 23:31:29 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * DevGuideExamples/DCPS/Messenger/run_ns_test.pl:

          on windows.

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest4_0/Reader.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/FooTest4_0/Writer.cpp:

Thu Oct 16 23:09:41 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * DevGuideExamples/DCPS/Messenger/run_ns_test.pl:

          Worked around nsadd executable name difference in DOC and other
          TAO version(1.4a and 1.5a). The script now verify nsadd executable
          file existence.

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPS_IR_Domain.cpp:

          Changed an LM_ERROR logging in find_topic_description to LM_DEBUG.

          Directed output to a file as the errors loggings are expected.

Thu Oct 16 19:50:35 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.cpp:

          Replaced _non_exist() call with _is_a() to validate repo connections.
          This would fix the 1.4a minimum_corba build issue due to _non_exist
          is not available in 1.4a.

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPS_IR_Domain.cpp:

          Fixed a warning in DDS_HAS_MINIMUM_BIT build.

          Fixed warnings.

Wed Oct 15 17:37:22 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfo_i.cpp:

          Made BIT transport configured with datalink_release_delay_=0, this
          makes the BIT transport send the graceful shutdown to the peer so
          the InfoRepo won't try to reconnect.

        * dds/InfoRepo/FederatorManagerImpl_updates.cpp:

          Fixed some warnings.

Wed Oct 15 15:56:53 UTC 2008  Friedhelm Wolf  <fwolf@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * dds/DCPS/BuiltInTopicUtils.h:

          Fixed a guid comparison problem.

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPS_IR_Topic.h:
        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPS_IR_Topic.cpp:

          Added release() to support topic deletion upon last associated
          sub/pub/topic object deletion. This would fix the access violation
          when sub/pub deletion updates happen after topic deletion.

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPS_IR_Domain.cpp:
        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPS_IR_Participant.cpp:

          - Made topic->release called upon removing sub/pub/topic.
          - Updated remove_all_dependents() to move iterator to next
            before removing sub/pub/topic to fix access violation.

        * dds/InfoRepo/FederatorManagerImpl.inl:

          Fixed orb reference counting issue.

        * dds/InfoRepo/FederatorManagerImpl.h:
        * dds/InfoRepo/FederatorManagerImpl_updates.cpp:

          - Added lock_ to protect the deferred updata samples.
          - Added processDeferred() call in each processCreate().
            This would fix missing update problem due to timing
            of multithreads handling participant/topic/sub/pub
            updates.
          - Added try and catch Invalid_Participant block for
            remove_topic/remove_publication/remove_subscription
            in case the remove_domain_participant is called
            before them.

        * dds/InfoRepo/FederatorManagerImpl.cpp:

          Changed an LM_ERROR message to LM_DEBUG message.

Tue Oct 14 19:11:47 UTC 2008  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DdsDcps.mpc:
        * dds/dcps_bits.mpb:

          Even with built_in_topics=0, we now need to use -Gdcps on
          DdsDcpsInfrastructure.idl because Federation is depending on the
          functions it generates.

        * java/tests/builtintopics/run_test.pl:
        * java/tests/complex_idl/run_test.pl:
        * java/tests/messenger/publisher/run_test.pl:
        * java/tests/messenger/subscriber/run_test.pl:

          Remove references to deprecated 'domain_ids' files.

        * wrapper/DDSWrapper_OpenDDS.mpc:

          Use "dynamic" flags to set the *_BUILD_DLL macros.

Tue Oct 14 15:18:14 UTC 2008  Chris Cleeland  <cleeland@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/Serializer/SerializerTest.cpp:

          Appended 'LL' to the constant used when ACE_SIZEOF_LONG_DOUBLE
          is 16.  Without this it was causing compile errors on at least
          Mac OS X 10.5.*.

Tue Oct 14 14:11:04 UTC 2008  Friedhelm Wolf  <fwolf@dre.vanderbilt.edu>

        * MPC/config/dds_wrapper.mpb:
        * wrapper/example/WrapperStockQuoter.m?c:

          Fixed scoreboard error by moving dds_wrapper.mpb file from
          the wrapper directory to the MPC/config directory and
          renamed MPC project files.

Mon Oct 13 21:36:42 UTC 2008  Steven Stallion  <stallions@ociweb.com>

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfoRepo.mpc:

          Fixed build breakage on static builds of DCPSInfoRepo.

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfo_i.h:
        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfo_i.cpp:

          Changed lock_ ACE_Recursive_Thread_Mutex to solve the deadlock
          on linux.

        * java/tests/messenger/publisher/domain_ids:
        * java/tests/messenger/subscriber/domain_ids:

          Removed these files.  Domain ID files are now depreceated.

Fri Oct 10 20:26:41 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          Corrected an debug logging.

        * dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/SubscriberImpl.cpp:

        * dds/DdsDcpsInfoUtils.idl:

          Added an enum TopicStatus - INTERNAL_ERROR .

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfo_i.h:
        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfo_i.cpp:

          Added lock_ to synchronize the servant implementations
          and the methods called by updater threads.

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPS_IR_Participant.cpp:

          Fixed a problem that the iterator is not accessible after
          remove_topic() is called.

        * dds/InfoRepo/FederatorManagerImpl_updates.cpp:

          Corrected a debug logging.

        * dds/InfoRepo/UpdateReceiver_T.cpp:

          Removed task wait() call from close() since close() can be
          called when thread exit. It'll cause problem waiting for
          itself to finish. Use stop() instead of close() to shutdown
          the UpdateReceiver task thread.

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfoRepo.cpp:

          Added pre-compile header.

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfoRepo.mpc:

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.cpp:

        Transitioned from using _validate_connection() to using
        _non_existant() to remove a dependency on a non-minimal CORBA
        feature.

Fri Oct 10 19:29:57 UTC 2008  Steven Stallion  <stallions@ociweb.com>

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfoRepoServ.h:
        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfoRepoServ_Export.h:

          Added Export macros for GCC 4.x and Windows builds.

          now a simple wrapper around the library.

Fri Oct 10 14:08:06 UTC 2008  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/FailoverListener.cpp:

          Added required #include of the PCH header.

Thu Oct  9 21:37:23 UTC 2008  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * dds/InfoRepo/Federator.idl:

          leave_and_shutdown()
          shutdown()

        * dds/InfoRepo/FederatorManagerImpl.cpp:

          leave_and_shutdown()
          shutdown()
            Implement the new IDL methods.

        * dds/InfoRepo/ShutdownInterface.h:

          Abstract interface used to propagate shutdown requests.

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfo_i.h:
        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfo_i.cpp:

          shutdown() - forward shutdown requests to new ShutdownInterface
                       reference provided via constructor.

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfoRepo.cpp:

          Implement the new ShutdownInterface and pass this to the

        * dds/DCPS/DomainParticipantFactoryImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DomainParticipantFactoryImpl/PublisherImpl.cpp:

          Fixed an iterator access violation due to iterator erasing
          while iterating on map or set. The delete_*() invalidates
          the iterator so the iterator has to be move forward for
          next iteration before delete_*() call.

        * dds/DCPS/FailoverListener.h:
        * dds/DCPS/FailoverListener.cpp:

          Install a FailoverListener object to the DCPSParticipant
          built-in topic DataReader when federated.  This listener will
          initiate failover sequencing on reciept of the
          on_subscription_lost() callback.
          Set the LIVELINESS.lease_duration value for the DCPSParticpant
          built-in topic DataReader to that specified by the
          FederationLivelinessDuration value when federated.

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.h:
        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.cpp:

          load_common_config() - added FederationLivelinessDuration key
            value to this section.  The default value is 60 seconds.
          federation_liveliness() - new methods to access a member
            containing the new FederationLivelinessDuration value.
          repsitory_lost() - simplified handling the case where the
            specified lost repository is not found.

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPS_IR_Domain.h:
        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPS_IR_Domain.cpp:

          Add argument when initializing the built-in topics to cause the
          DCPSParticipant built-in topic to use a non-infinite
          LIVELINESS.lease_duration value.

          add_domain_participant() - changed signature to return a
            structure with both the previously returned Id value as well
            as a boolean indication of whether the repository is a
            federated repository.

        * dds/DCPS/DomainParticipantFactoryImpl.cpp:

          Use modified add_domain_participant() signature.

        * tests/DCPS/DCPSInfoRepo/publisher.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/DCPSInfoRepo/subscriber.cpp:

          Use modified add_domain_participant() signature.

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfoRepo.cpp:

          Made TAO_DDS_DCPSInfo_i servant be member of InfoRepo instead of
          in the scope of init() function. It is deleted when exit from
          init(). This should fix access violation on the TAO_DDS_DCPSInfo_i
          object and its members.

        * dds/InfoRepo/FederatorManagerImpl.cpp:

          Made listener thread stop in finalize ().

                              set_repo() into separate method.
          repository_lost() - added new method to failover to new
                              repository.
          Added configurable variables and accessors/mutators for
            FederationRecoveryDuration

Mon Oct  6 22:22:34 UTC 2008  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

          Merged the Federation branch back onto the trunk.  This feature
          branch developed the basic infrastructure to support federation
          of multiple repositories.  This feature is intended to provide
          fault-tolerant capabilities to the DCPSInfoRepo service
          meta-data repositories.  Details of the development can be
          found in the file 'history/ChangeLog-Federation'.

          See the file 'DDS_release_notes.txt' for a description
          of changes made that affect the user API to OpenDDS.
          Briefly, these changes include: removal of domain_ids domain
          specification files; extension of internal Id values from 32
          to 128 bits; ability to federate multiple repositories for
          distributed operation.

        * java:

          Added this entire subtree for the "OpenDDS Java Bindings",
          which allows Java applications to use OpenDDS.  This will not be
          built unless the MPC feature "java" is enabled.  JAVA_HOME and

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleUnreliableDgram/SimpleMcastTransport.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleUnreliableDgram/SimpleUdpTransport.cpp:

          Updated local_address_str with port picked by OS when local_address
          is configured with "localhost:" (or "localhost:0"). This bug makes
          SimpleUdp test fail to establish connection but does not affect
          SimpleMcast Transport since it does not use the local_address
          for connection info exchange via DCPSInfoRepo.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/ReliableMulticast/detail/ReactivePacketSender.cpp:

          Updated local_address_ with port actually using. The local_address_str
          in configuration object is not updated for ReliableMulticast if the
          configuration does not specify the port or use 0. This is fine as it
          does not use the local_address_str for connection info exchange via
          DCPSInfoRepo. It needs more work to get it updated.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.cpp:

          TCP already handled the "localhost:" case but added a minor change.

Tue Jul 22 18:38:51 UTC 2008  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * performance-tests/DCPS/InfoRepo_population/run_test.pl:

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.cpp:

          - Made fully_associated () function remove fully associated
            pub-sub pair from acks map instead of removing all acks
            for a pub. This bug made the DataWriter::fully_associated()
            not called if the ack arrives before DataWriter
            receives add_associations() call from DCPSInfoRepo.

          - Made acked_sub_map_.demarshal() call guarded by lock_.
            This bug may cause access violation when one thread is
            demarshlling ack message and updating ack map while another
            thread is removing acks from ack map.

          - Added remove_ack() to support removal of pub-sub id pair from
            ack map.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/ReliableMulticast/ReliableMulticastTransportImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/ReliableMulticast/ReliableMulticastTransportImpl.inl:

           Overrode remove_ack() to be noop for UDP and MCAST transports since they
           do not require ack from subscriber.

Tue Jul 22 15:55:55 UTC 2008  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb>

        * performance-tests/DCPS/InfoRepo_population/run_test.pl:

          Added some selectable diagnostic options.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Sync/SyncClient_i.h:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/Sync/SyncClient_i.cpp:

          Added lock around access to the notification_ member.

Sun Jul 20 18:16:57 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:

          Made send strategy remove samples when scheduling datalink
          release with a delay. This would avoid problem that the sample
          from previous association could not be delivered.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:

          Made send_delayed_notifications called before changing the
          mode in clear().

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Sync/SyncClient_i.cpp:

          Fixed a warning.

        * tests/DCPS/sub_init_loop/pub.ini:
        * tests/DCPS/sub_init_loop/sub.ini:

          Set the datalink_release_delay=0 to avoid timing issue on
          receiving add_assocition,remove_association and fully_associate
          calls because of delayed datalink release.

          Commented the local_address or made it not specify port.
          This is to avoid using fixed port in case the port is

              Supported configurable delay for datalink release after no associations.
              This is to fix disconnect problem happened when removing and adding
              association related to same datalink during short period. The new connection
              is established before remove_association call which results in new connection
              been disconnect.
              Removed keep_link support which can be replaced with long
              datalink_release_delay value.

              Added "notify_both_side" parameter to remove_associated_publication/subscription
              methods to allow remove_associations() invocation on both datareader
              and datawriter upon qos change. This intends to make the remove_associations
              call earlier than add_associations to avoid same datalink removing/adding timing
              issue.

              application requires to keep the datalink alive for longer
              time, it could configure datalink_release_delay to a big

              The changes are to trigger the TheServiceParticipant singleton
              created and has ORB created or provided so it can be accessed
              during transport shutdown. The TheServiceParticipant->shutdown
              should always be called after TheTransportFactory->release.

                        violation.
                      - Made remove_association always be called before
                        add_association when re-evaluating the associations.
                        Otherwise, the new association has trouble to connect
                        when the removed associations and added association using
                        the same datalink. This would fix SetQoSPartition test

                    These changes made DCPSInfoRepo re-evaluate the compatibility and
                    associations when QoS change is made. The QoS RxO and changeable
                    property determine whether re-evaluation is needed for a specific
                    QoS.

                      changed QoS. If changed QoS is not compatible then it will return
                      error code to set_qos and the QoS will not be changed(e.g. deadline).
                      If the changed QoS is compatible or do not need be compatible
                      (e.g. partition) and affect association, then it may result in
                      removing existing associations or adding new associations.

        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/README:

          Updated the patch for reproduce and verify RT11348 fix.

Thu Jul  3 00:28:51 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        Fixed a race condition described in RT11348. The commit
        at "Fri Jun 27 19:42:06 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>"
        broke some tests. This time the fix was fully tested.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:

          Added pub_map_releasing_ and sub_map_releasing_ to save the snapshot
          of associations in datalink at the time the link is declared for releasing
          resource due to connection problem. The DataLinkCleanupTask will remove the
          associations based on the snapshot. This would fix the problem that new
          associations are removed while removing the old associations due to a failed
          connection. The problem occurs when actual removal is performed with a delay
          after the datalink lost its connection.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkCleanupTask.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkCleanupTask.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.inl:

          Moved the datalink cleanup operations in DataLinkCleanupTask::execute to a
          new function (clear_associations()) in DataLink class and removed TransportImpl
          reference in DataLinkCleanupTask as it's not needed.

          Added operator= and clear functions to support map copy and clear.

        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/README:

          Added description of dl_clean test case to reproduce the bug and verify the fix.
          The dl_clean test can not be run in an automated nightly build since it requires
          a special patch to prove the fix.

        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/run_test.pl:

          Added dl_clean test case.

          allow us to not have to specify "Source_Files" in most cases, but the
          dcps_ts.pl custom type is not yet taking advantage of this new MPC
          feature.

        * MPC/config/dcps_reliable_multicast.mpb:

          Modified to inherit from dcps (since the library project does the
          same).

        * MPC/config/dcpsexe_with_reliable_multicast.mpb:

          Removed the addition of ReliableMulticast to libs and after, since
          it inherits from dcps_reliable_multicast.

        * tests/transport/reliable_multicast/reliable_multicast.mpc:

          Modified to inherit from dcps_reliable_multicast instead of adding
          the ReliableMulticast library manually.

        * MPC/config/dcps_ts_defaults.mpb:

          Modified to indicate a source, header and generic output
          extension for the change below.

        * bin/DCPS/HTemplate.pm:
        * bin/DCPS/IDLTemplate.pm:
        * bin/dcps_ts.pl:

          Modified this script to create a single idl, header, and source
          file no matter how many types are contained within the input idl
          file.  This allows the output file names to be based upon the
          input file name (instead of the types found in the idl file).

        * bin/update_dcps.pl:

          This new script updates MPC and C++ source files to use the new
          dcps_ts.pl output file names.  It only truly works if you allow it
          to work on the directory so that it can edit the MPC files and
          with knowlege gained from that, edit the C++ source files.

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          - Added pending reader list to keep track the pending reader so it can be
            distinguished from fully associated reader and also added code to manage
            state transition. This would fix some errors if remove_associations()
            is called before fully_associated() call.
          - Changed reader_ to be std::set<RepoId> instead of ReaderIdSeq to simplify
            implementation for insertion and deletion.

        * tests/DCPS/sub_init_loop/subscriber.cpp:

          Removed the delay between delete_datareader and create_datareader, but
          still keep the delay between create_datareader and delete_datareader
          which is needed to avoid problem that datareader removal in DCPSInfoRepo
          cause bit lookup failure upon fully association.

          Corrected the class name passed to ACE_DES_FREE macro.

Wed Jun 18 20:37:23 UTC 2008  Ossama Othman  <othmano@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DurabilityArray.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DurabilityQueue.h:

          MS VC++ requires an explicitly defined destructor for this
          particular use case.  Added one.

Wed Jun 18 19:08:38 UTC 2008  Ossama Othman  <othmano@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataDurabilityCache.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataDurabilityCache.h:

          Reset allocator address stored in persistent objects retrieved
          from the backing store by using new DurabilityArray and
          DurabilityQueue classes.  Addresses a crash on process exit when
          using PERSISTENT DURABILITY.

          Fixed Linux build error.  The MAP_TYPE macro is already defined
          by the <sys/mman.h> system header.

          Reset the underlying queue after retrieving data so that the
          data is not duplicated if the DataWriter ends up reinserting the
          same data into the durability cache.

        * dds/DCPS/DurabilityArray.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DurabilityQueue.h:

          New source files containing subclasses of ACE_Array_Base<> and
          ACE_Unbounded_Queue<>, respectively, that provide a means to
          reset the allocator.  Needed to properly support persistent
          durable data that is accessed between different process runs.

        * tests/DCPS/PersistentDurability/subscriber.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/TransientDurability/publisher.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/TransientDurability/subscriber.cpp:

          Fixed memory leaks by assigning newly allocated type support
          servant to the appropriate "_var" type.

Wed Jun 18 14:05:20 UTC 2008  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataDurabilityCache.cpp:

          Re-applied one Borland fix and extended it to the map type as well
          as the list.

Wed Jun 18 08:00:17 UTC 2008  Ossama Othman  <othmano@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataDurabilityCache.cpp:

          Added missing calls to ACE_Allocator::bind()/find().  They are
          necessary for retrieving persistent data from the backing
          store.

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/WriteDataContainer.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/WriteDataContainer.h:

          Take into account LIFESPAN QoS policy value when reenqueuing
          data for TRANSIENT_LOCAL, TRANSIENT and PERSISTENT DURABILITY
          enabled writes.

        * tests/DCPS/PersistentDurability/run_test.pl:

          Unlink the durability backing store file before and after
          running the test so that stale data does not skew the results.

Tue Jun 17 23:59:42 UTC 2008  Ossama Othman  <othmano@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataDurabilityCache.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataDurabilityCache.h:

          Use an ACE_Hash_Map_With_Allocator_T<> map instead of the "_Ex"
          version just in case the allocator address changes between
          process runs.

          Allocate the map itself with the allocator so that its state
          (size, etc) is reflected in the backing store in the persistent
          case.

Tue Jun 17 22:22:25 UTC 2008  Ossama Othman  <othmano@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/PersistentDurability/Writer.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/PersistentDurability/publisher.cpp:

          Applied TransientDurability test changes below to the
          PersistentDurability test.

Tue Jun 17 22:11:56 UTC 2008  Ossama Othman  <othmano@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/TransientDurability/Writer.cpp
          (num_instances_per_writer):

          Increased this constant from 1 to 2.  Increases concurrency in
          the test, and addresses subscriber waiting indefinitely for data
          to arrive.

        * tests/DCPS/TransientDurability/publisher.cpp:

          Increased publication match loop delay and iterations.
          Addresses a problem where the publisher would end prior to a
          subscription match.

Tue Jun 17 21:55:25 UTC 2008  Ossama Othman  <othmano@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp (fully_associated):

          Resend data for TRANSIENT and PERSISTENT durability, just like
          what is done for TRANSIENT_LOCAL.

Tue Jun 17 20:34:28 UTC 2008  Ossama Othman  <othmano@ociweb.com>

        * bin/dcps_tests.lst:

          Run TransientDurability and PersistentDurability tests in the
          nightly builds.

Tue Jun 17 18:39:13 UTC 2008  Ossama Othman  <othmano@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/Partition/Partition_Table.h (PartitionConfig):

          Added constructor to silence g++ 3.2 and Borland C++ warnings.

Tue Jun 17 16:05:57 UTC 2008  Jonathan Pollack  <pollack_j@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/Compiler/idl_test3_main/main.cpp:

          Fixed a warning for Borland.

Tue Jun 17 07:41:11 UTC 2008  Ossama Othman  <othmano@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataDurabilityCache.cpp:

          Addressed crashes that were introduced during the memory
          management rewrite.

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp (enable):

          Retrieve data from the durability cache after the DataWriter is
          completely enabled.  Addresses a publication ID mismatch error.

        * tests/DCPS/PersistentDurability/publisher.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/TransientDurability/publisher.cpp:

          Set the DURABILITY_SERVICE DataWriter QoS policy history_kind
          value to ::DDS::KEEP_ALL_HISTORY_QOS so that all samples are
          persisted, instead of the default (one).

Tue Jun 17 04:49:17 UTC 2008  Ossama Othman  <othmano@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataDurabilityCache.cpp:

          Updated some comments to avoid referring to unsent data.

        * dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.cpp (delete_datawriter):

          Initiate durability related data caching prior to unregistering
          all samples.  Addresses problem where sample list was of zero
          size by the time durability caching occurred.

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/WriteDataContainer.cpp (persist_data):
        * dds/DCPS/WriteDataContainer.h (persist_data):

          New method explicitly called by publisher servant to trigger
          durability related caching, as opposed to implicit caching at
          WriteDataContainer destruction-time.

Mon Jun 16 21:22:24 UTC 2008  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/ReliableMulticast/ReliableMulticastTransportImpl.h:

          Added one more #include needed by Borland.

Mon Jun 16 08:47:45 UTC 2008  Ossama Othman  <othmano@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataDurabilityCache.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataDurabilityCache.h:

          Include domain ID as part of durability cache map key.  This
          must now be done explicitly since the durability cache resides
          within the Service_Participant, meaning we no longer get
          domain-specificness for free.

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp (enable):

          Get the data durability cache from the Service_Participant since
          it no longer resides in the publisher servant.

        * dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.h:

          Moved data durability caches to the Service_Participant to
          better support the spec requirements.

        * dds/DCPS/WriteDataContainer.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/WriteDataContainer.h:

          Added DomainId_t member.  Data durability caching operations now
          require the domain ID.

Sun Jun 15 22:29:02 UTC 2008  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * tests/transport/dds_comparative/pub_main.cpp:
        * tests/transport/dds_comparative/sub_main.cpp:

          Added a few more #includes needed by Borland.

Sat Jun 14 21:43:49 UTC 2008  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/ReliableMulticast/ReliableMulticastTransportImpl.h:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/dummyTCP/DummyTcpConnection.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:

          Added #includes that Borland requires, in just a few cases gcc332
          doesn't accept these, so they have been placed within #ifdef guards
          for __BORLANDC__.

        * examples/DCPS/IntroductionToOpenDDS/StockQuoter.mpc:

          Projects that create executables should not set any "dynamicflags".

        * tests/DCPS/MultiRepoTest/TestMonitor.cpp:

          Added .in() in two instances where vars are passed to is_nil().

          Moved TransportImpl reference release from just right before exit
          from main to before transport release. This intended to fix the
          access violation during shutdown in some optimize build on linux.
          I think TransportImpl object cleanup may reference some resouces
          that already released.

        * tests/DCPS/ViewState/main.cpp:

          Fixed a timing issue in the test. The test case 2 should wait until
          dispose and data sample(from write() after dispose) are both received
          before verifying view state change in multiple generations. Current
          test just wait for new sample which may be just dispose sample. Now
          the dispose sample was read so the view state be NOT_NEW and sample
          state be READ before write() call and we can verify the new sample
          changed the states.

Thu Jun 12 22:35:11 UTC 2008  Ossama Othman  <othmano@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/Lifespan/Writer.cpp (write):

          Added a write() call after the bogus write_w_timestamp() calls
          to make sure valid data is demarshalled correctly after expired
          data is rejected.

        * tests/DCPS/Lifespan/subscriber.cpp (main):

        * dds/DCPS/DataDurabilityCache.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataDurabilityCache.h:

          Moved code out of TransientDataDurabilityCache.* to these files,
          and rewrote code to utilize allocators to allow the same code to
          be used by both TRANSIENT and PERSISTENT durability QoS
          configurations.

        * dds/DCPS/DataSampleList.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DataSampleList.inl:

          Added source_timestamp field to simplify access of that value
          for each sample when transferring data to the durability cache.

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          Delay start of requested deadline watchdog until first
          association is established.  There is no reason to start it
          before then.

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Delay start of offered deadline watchdog until the DataWriter is
          enabled.  There is no reason to start it  before then.

          Updated code to use new durability cache interface.

          Initialize the DataSampleListElement::source_timestamp field
          when writing.  That value will later be store in the durability
          cache.

          Moved the datalink cleanup task shutdown to the begin of shutdown()
          function instead of the end of the function. This would fix access
          violation when transport_detached() wiped the TransportImpl reference
          in TransportInterface while datalink clean task is removing associations.

          connection. This would synchronize sub and pub to make the pub
          add_associations called after sub opened a port for listening.
          It should resolve the "Failed to connect" problem on publication
          side.

Wed May 28 17:04:00 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.cpp:

          Made fresh_link() ignore the nil connection(new datalink/connection) case.
          This would avoid nil connection error on SimpleTcpDataLink::reconnect().
          The connection could be nil in fresh_link() when the new connection is
          accepted before the connection is associated with the datalink in
          make_passive_connection.

        * tests/DCPS/sub_init_loop/subscriber.cpp:

          Added delay between getting matched publication and delete_datareader call.
          This would avoid the bit lookup timeout issue. The problem observed is the
          remove_associations for the same reader could be called before the
          fully_associted message is received on datawriter side. It has to have delay
          to ensure the DataWriter received fully_associated call before subscriber
          deletes datareader.

          Do not check for nil CORBA::String_var by comparing to NULL.
          Compare to zero instead since TAO's CORBA::String_var uses zero,
          not NULL.  The NULL constant is not guaranteed to be zero.

        * dds/DdsDcpsInfrastructure.idl (TRANSPORTTYPE_QOS_POLICY_NAME):
          (TRANSPORTTYPE_QOS_POLICY_ID):

          Moved these constants from DDS namespace to OpenDDS namespace
          since they are specific to OpenDDS.

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/OfferedDeadlineWatchdog.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/OfferedDeadlineWatchdog.h:
        * dds/DCPS/RequestedDeadlineWatchdog.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/RequestedDeadlineWatchdog.h:

          Pass "this" pointer to Watchdog object.  The Watchdog object
          now dynamically retrieves the Listener object each time it times
          out the listener may be changed by the application.

        * dds/DCPS/DataSampleHeader.h (source_timestamp_nanosec_):

          Changed this field's type from ACE_INT32 to ACE_UINT32 to match
          corresponding type ::DDS::Time_t::nanosec field type,
          i.e. CORBA::ULong.

        * dds/DCPS/Qos_Helper.h:
        * dds/DCPS/Qos_Helper.inl:

          (operator<):

          Handle the INFINITY case explicitly since the DDS spec does not
          define infinite nanosec value to be the maximum possible value
          for the underlying type.

          (operator<=):

          Tightened up operator<= implementation so that it is implemented
          in terms of operator< alone, instead of both operator< and
          operator==.

          (operator!=, operator>, operator>=):

          Added !=, > and >= operators for the DDS::Duration_t type.
          Allows for simplification of some Duration_t comparisons.

          Moved relational operators ahead of Qos_Helper methods that use
          them.  Some compilers require the inline definition to appear
          before its use.

          (lease_greater_than):

          Removed this method.  Use the new greater-than operator
          instead.

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPS_Utils.cpp (compatibleQOS):

          The TRANSPORTTYPE_QOS_POLICY_ID constant is now in the OpenDDS
          namespace.

          Use operator>() instead of
          OpenDDS::Qos_Helper::lease_greater_than().  The latter no longer
          exists.

          Added missing DEADLINE compatibility check.  The DDS
          specification requires the offered deadline period to be less
          than or equal to the requested deadline period.

May 22 16:28:59 UTC 2008  Brian Johnson  <johnsonb@ociweb.com>:

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Added note about memory management and possible crashes on exit.

        * tests/DCPS/CompatibilityTest/README:
        * tests/DCPS/UnitTests/README:

          Improved documentation on these tests.

Wed May 21 12:41:03 UTC 2008  Jonathan Pollack  <pollack_j@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/ZeroCopySeq_T.cpp:

          Committed a fix for unsupported Borland compilers.

Wed May 21 06:23:12 UTC 2008  Ossama Othman  <othmano@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.h:

          Do not push expired data to the application, where expiration is
          determined through the LIFESPAN QoS policy value.

        * dds/DCPS/Qos_Helper.inl (time_value_to_time):
          (time_value_to_duration):

          Reinstated use of truncate_cast<> instead of static_cast<> that
          was lost during the RT11951/trunk merge.

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPS_IR_Domain.cpp (publish_topic_bit):
          (publish_publication_bit):

          Retrieve DURABILITY_SERVICE value from appropriate Qos type.

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPS_Utils.cpp (compatibleQOS):

          Removed duplicate DURABILITY and LIVELINESS compatibility
          checks.

Wed May 21 06:17:31 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:

          Added remove_handler call before disconnecting backpressure connection
          in notify_lost_on_backpressure_timeout(). This is to solve access
          violation on connection object when reactor cleanup the event handles
          during shutdown.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.cpp:

          Removed connection reference in stop_i() to be consistent with send
          strategy.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy.cpp:

          Removed code to register/remove connection handle with reactor since
          the receive strategy already remove old connection handle and register
          new connection handle.

        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/pub.ini:
        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/sub.ini:

          Used fixed port to test reconnect logic on both pub and sub.

Wed May 21 04:53:22 UTC 2008  Ossama Othman  <othmano@ociweb.com>

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Removed "FIXES PENDING" comments.

Wed May 21 03:55:23 UTC 2008  Ciju John  <johnc at ociweb dot com>

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:
          Add description for "-DCPSTransportDebugLevel" option.

Tue May 20 23:26:50 UTC 2008  Jonathan Pollack  <pollack_j@ociweb.com>

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Updated for default multicast address.

        * dds/InfoRepo/PersistenceUpdater.cpp:

          Fixed a memory leak that the old qos data should be deleted when new qos data
          is added to the hash map.

Tue May 20 20:04:28 UTC 2008  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest4_0/main.cpp:

          Resolved warnings on gcc 4.1.1.

Tue May 20 18:27:01 UTC 2008  Ossama Othman  <othmano@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Qos_Helper.h:
        * dds/DCPS/Qos_Helper.inl:

          Refactored DDS::Duration_t value validation code.

          Added missing DURABILITY_SERVICE QoS validation code.

          Refactored HISTORY and RESOURCE_LIMITS QoS validation code so
          that it may be leveraged by DURABILITY_SERVICE validation code.

          Code clean-up.

Tue May 20 16:08:09 UTC 2008  Brian Johnson  <johnsonb@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataSampleList.h:

          Changed TransportSendElementAllocator to use ACE_Thread_Mutex instead of ACE_Null_Mutex.
          Previously malloc and free did not have locked access.

Mon May 19 22:23:58 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfoRepo.cpp:

          Made listener address use ACE_IPV6_LOCALHOST for IPv6 build.

Mon May 19 21:55:23 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          Fixed a bug in add_associations() that called
          subscriber_servant_->add_associations() twice.

Fri May 16 11:45:42 UTC 2008  Jonathan Pollack  <pollack_j@ociweb.com>

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Updated release version information.

        * tests/DCPS/BuiltInTopicTest/prst_repo_run_test.pl:
        * tests/DCPS/Prst_delayed_subscriber/run_test.pl:

          Made endpoint port to be randomly picked instead of a fixed
          number. This avoids nightly build test failure because the port
          may be used by other tests.

Thu May 15 14:52:24 UTC 2008  Brian Johnson  <johnsonb@ociweb.com>

        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/run_test-1p1s.pl:

        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/run_test-2p3s.pl:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/run_test-4p1s.pl:

          Reduced the time it takes to complete test on a failure.

        * tests/DCPS/LivelinessTimeout/DataReaderListener.cpp:

          Fixed to only count publishers that went from active to inactive
          as missed.

Thu May 15 06:59:20 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.cpp:

          Moved the DataLinkCleanupTask close to shutdown() instead of in
          destructor. This makes the thread exit upon shutdown and not impacted
          by whether the TransportImpl destructor is called or not.

Wed May 14 20:14:17 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Added ipv6 support feature and other features and bug fixes.

Wed May 14 03:23:00 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:

          - Fixed a problem that the re-established connection failed state
          check when send strategy resume send. The problem is an active
          disconnect due to the peer graceful disconnect did not terminate
          send.

          - Added new method active_connect which is thread protected and
          moved non-thread protected version active_establishment() to be
          private. This would avoid the same connection connect multiple
          times when add_associations() related to same datalink be handled
          simalteneously.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.cpp:

          Replaced connection active_establishment() call with active_connect().

Tue May 13 16:37:06 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/LivelinessTest/DataReaderListener.cpp:

          Corrected last on_liveliness_change call status verification.

        * tests/DCPS/LivelinessTimeout/DataReaderListener.h:
        * tests/DCPS/LivelinessTimeout/DataReaderListener.cpp:

          Removed inactive_count_ and test_failed() method as they are not
          needed.

        * tests/DCPS/LivelinessTimeout/subscriber.cpp:

          Removed test_failed() verification from listener.

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Fixed remove_association to not try to remove same writer/reader
          multiple times.
          Corrected the liveliness implementation to make consistent active
          count and inactive count changes. The active count is increased when
          writer became active and is decreased when it became dead from ACTIVE
          state or remove_association is called. The inactive count is increased
          when the writer became dead from ACTIVE state and is decreased when
          it became active from DEAD state or remove_association is called.

          avoid race condition.

Mon May 12 19:02:53 UTC 2008  Ciju John  <johnc at ociweb dot com>

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest5/publisher.cpp:

          Close the writers_completed file as soon as possible, so changes are
          flushed to the disk.

          Making sure the ReactorTask isn't destroyed till the socket is destroyed.

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfo_i.cpp:

          This code went in to fix a memory leak, but exercises infrastructure code that
          isn't valid while we are going down.  Removing the code since currently this is
          only at shutdown.

          Fixed problem in get_fully_qualified_hostname() that returns the loopback
          address resolved name without checking the non-loopback network interfaces.
          The get_fully_qualified_hostname() will return the name in the order whoever
          is found first - FQDN, short hostname, name resolved from loopback address.
          In the case using short hostname or name resolved from loopback address, a
          warning is logged. If there is no any name discovered from network interfaces,
          an error is logged and an empty string is returned.

        * DevGuideExamples/DCPS/Messenger/StackDataReaderListener.h:
        * DevGuideExamples/DCPS/Messenger/StackDataReaderListener.cpp:

          The implementation for DataReaderListener that doesn't inherit from LocalObject<...>,
          so no reference counting is performed

        * DevGuideExamples/DCPS/Messenger/run_test.pl:

          Added code to run the stack based example when "stack" is passed to the perl script.

        * DevGuideExamples/DCPS/Messenger/stack_subscriber.cpp:

          Exactly the same code as subscriber.cpp, except that StackDataReaderListener is created on the stack.

        * DevGuideExamples/DCPS/Messenger/subscriber.cpp:

          Cleaned up unnecessary template parameter.

        * bin/dcps_tests.lst:

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Fixed a deadlock situation that happens between fully_associated()
          thread and write()/register() thread when using
          TRANSIENT_LOCAL_DURABILITY_QOS. The two threads acquire writer
          container lock and publisher lock in reverse order. Making
          fully_associated() to acquire the write container lock before calling
          PublisherImpl::data_available() would resolve the deadlock.

        * tests/DCPS/TransientLocalTest/subscriber.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/TransientLocalTest/README:

          Added the test case for the deadlock fix.
          To simulate the test scenario, the PublisherImpl::data_availabe()
          need be modified to have sleep for 2 seconds before send(list) if
          resend is true. Without the fix, a deadlock happened in this test.
          With the fix, the test should pass.

          This made reliable mcast to support default configuration to be consistent with unreliable
          mcast.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/ReliableMulticast/ReliableMulticastTransportConfiguration.cpp:

          Removed error returns when local_address and mcast_group_address are not configured in
          the configuration file. The code default values are used when the addresses are not
          configured.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/ReliableMulticast/ReliableMulticastTransportImpl.cpp:

          Added debug logging for advertisement address.

        Continued the effort to support IPv6 (RT11158).

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.cpp:

          Used set_port_number() instead of creating an ACE_INET_Addr with port number.
          It fixed the problem that ipv4 address was introduced by the constructor in IPv6 build.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/NetworkAddress.cpp:

          Updated the get_fully_qualified_hostname() function to work for both ipv4 and ipv6
          builds on current DDS supported platforms.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConfiguration.inl:

          Removed code to set the local_address with port 0 and INADDR_ANY which should
          only apply to ipv4. Leave it use the default constructor. This would fix ipv4
          address used in ipv6 build problem.

        * dds/DCPS/SubscriberImpl.cpp:

          Making the code clearer by creating a _var, rather than a
          temporary variable.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.cpp:

          Deleting AssociationInfoList in pending_association_sub_map_.

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfoRepo.cpp:

          Was previously using an auto_ptr to manage a reference counted
          object.  Changed to use a ServantBase_var

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfo_i.cpp:

          Removing all DCPS_IR_Domains stored in the map on destruction.

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfo_i.cpp:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/Sync/SyncServer_i.cpp:

          Memory was being lost since the memory returned by object_to_string was
          only being copied (std::string ctor), so changed to CORBA::String_var.

Mon Apr 28 15:06:59 UTC 2008  Brian Johnson  <johnsonb@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DomainParticipantImpl.cpp:

          Moved code for adding new memory to a var, to avoid potential memory leak.

        * dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.cpp:

          Moved call to detatch_transport back to destructor, until I can look at its
          effects. Removed wrong function comment. Put dw_servant->get_publisher()
          inside a var, since the function duplicates the ptr.

        * dds/DCPS/SubscriberImpl.cpp:

          Put dw_servant->get_publisher() inside a var, since the function duplicates
          the ptr.
          For RT#12161.

Mon Apr 28 05:16:00 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:

          Fixed a compilation warning.

Sun Apr 27 06:49:34 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        The main changes are using the address string instead of IP and port for
        pub/sub endpoint addresss advertisement and fixed problem that default
        local_address configurations do not work when hostname is resolved as loopback
        ip address. (See RT12134).

        The address string advertisement changes were made to support the IPv6 as well,
        but more tests need be done. e.g. test on pure ipv6 machine.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/NetworkAddress.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/NetworkAddress.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/NetworkAddress.cpp:

          Made NetworkAddress struct a wrapper of the stringified address and added
          serialize and deserialize methods. A reserved byte is added for the version
          support in the future.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConfiguration.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConfiguration.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleUnreliableDgram/SimpleUdpConfiguration.cpp:

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleUnreliableDgram/SimpleUnreliableDgramConfiguration.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleUnreliableDgram/SimpleUnreliableDgramTransport.cpp:

          Added local_address_str_ data member for address advertisement. The address string
          is either from the configuration or uses code default. The acceptor defaults to
          listening on INADDR_ANY if the local_address_ is not configured, but the fully
          qualified hostname with the port number randomly picked by OS is sent to
          DCPSInfoRepo for endpoint advertisement. This would fix the problem that default
          local_address configurations do not work when hostname is resolved as loopback
          ip address.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:

          Made connection send local address string instead of whole NetworkAddress after
          connection establishment. This simplifies the implementation which does not need
          serialize and deserialize the NetworkAddress.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/ReliableMulticast/ReliableMulticastTransportConfiguration.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/ReliableMulticast/ReliableMulticastTransportConfiguration.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/ReliableMulticast/ReliableMulticastTransportImpl.cpp:

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleUnreliableDgram/SimpleMcastTransport.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleUnreliableDgram/SimpleMcastTransport.cpp:

          Added multicast_group_address_str_ which is either from configuration file or
          uses code default. The default multicast group address is
          ACE_DEFAULT_MULTICAST_ADDR:ACE_DEFAULT_MULTICAST_PORT.

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Changed _var to self to release in cleanup phase rather than
          destruction.  Also moved topic_var release into cleanup, but
          still need to for Participant and Publisher.

        * dds/DCPS/DomainParticipantFactoryImpl.cpp:

          Removed unneeded _add_ref and _remove_ref for domain
          participant.  Also cleaned up commented out code.

        * dds/DCPS/DomainParticipantImpl.cpp:

          Removed unneeded _add_ref and _remove_ref for topic, pub and
          sub, and added call to cleanup the registered typeSupport for
          this participant.  Also cleaned up commented out code.

        * dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.cpp:

          Chaned _var to self to release in cleanup phase rather than
          destruction.  Also moved releasing the participant and detaching
          the transport to the cleanup phase, rather than destruction.

        * dds/DCPS/Registered_Data_Types.h:
        * dds/DCPS/Registered_Data_Types.cpp:

          Added unregister_participant to unregister all the typeSupports
          for that participant.

        * dds/InfoRepo/UpdateManager.cpp:

          - Implemented feature to update qos to persistent repository.

          - Fixed incorrect actor type and qos type for subscriber/datareader
            problem in UpdateManager::add(const UA& actor). This bug causes the
            reloading from persistent file maps the subscriber/datareader as
            publisher/datawriter.

          - Fixed a bug in qos serialization. The TAO_OutputCDR stream was not
            fully copied to buffer when the qos contains sequence data. The
            TAO_OutputCDR stream needs be consolidated before memcpy.

        * dds/DCPS/SubscriberImpl.cpp:

          Rolled back the last two commits for dispose notification feature.
          These changes were moved to RT11951 branch.

Tue Mar 18 17:24:37 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:

          Moved instance state update for dispose before listener callback
          instead after so the dispose notification SampleInfo has the
          correct instance state - NOT_ALIVE_DISPOSED_INSTANCE_STATE.

        * DevGuideExamples/DCPS/Messenger/DataReaderListener.cpp:

          Added debug logging for the instance state.

Tue Mar 18 07:21:00 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:

          Implemented datareader dispose notification. The datareader
          adds an entry for dispose message to the instance
          ReceivedDataElementList. The ReceivedDataElement has the
          registered_data_ member set to be 0 and the corresponding
          SampleInfo is marked with valid_data false. The subscriber
          checks the valid_data flag in SampleInfo before looking the
          data.

        * dds/DCPS/InstanceState.inl:

          Setup SampleInfo valid_data flag in sample_info() function.

        * dds/DdsDcpsInfrastructure.idl:

          Added publication_handle and valid_data to the SampleInfo
          according to the DDS spec 1.2.

        * DevGuideExamples/DCPS/Messenger/DataReaderListener.cpp:
        * DevGuideExamples/DCPS/Messenger/Writer.cpp:
        * DevGuideExamples/DCPS/Messenger/subscriber.cpp:

          Added explicit dispose () call on publisher side and valid_data
          flag check on subscriber side. These are used to test dispose
          notification via on_data_available() callback.

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest4_0/Reader.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/FooTest4_0/main.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/ViewState/main.cpp:

          Accommodated to the changes of dispose notification support.
          The sample_rank and expected samples were changed to count
          the dispose notification as well.

        * dds/DCPS/SubscriberImpl.cpp:

          Used the datareader_map_ instead of datareader_set_ to get
          the list of datareaders for subscriber qos propagation.
          This would fix the timing issue that subscriber qos does
          not propagate when the subscriber set_qos is called before
          datareaders receive any messages.

        * tests/transport/mcast_simple_n/run_test.pl:
        * tests/transport/simple_bp_rm/run_test.pl:
        * tests/transport/udp_simple_n/run_test.pl:

Fri Mar 14 19:07:28 UTC 2008  Brian Johnson  <johnsonb@ociweb.com>

        * bin/dcps_tests.lst:

          Added LivelinessTimeout test.

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          works needs to be done.

Wed Mar  5 19:15:31 UTC 2008  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/ZeroCopySeq_T.cpp:

          Added a const_cast required by Borland (and the C++ spec, but none of
          the other compilers complained).  Thanks to Johnny Willemsen for
          testing OpenDDS with the Borland compiler.

Tue Mar  4 23:41:52 UTC 2008  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * DevGuideExamples/DCPS/Messenger/run_test.pl:
        * bin/dcps_tests.lst:

          Added a new test configuration ("nobits") that verifies that built-in
          topics can be disabled at runtime.  See the FAQ on opendds.org.

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.h:
        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.cpp:
        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfoRepo.cpp:

          Restored the ability to turn off BITs at runtime by passing -NOBITS
          on the DCPSInfoRepo command line.  This seems to have been lost in
          the recent (post-1.0) commits.

        * docs/INSTALL:

          Fixed some formatting.

Tue Feb 26 15:17:41 UTC 2008  Brian Johnson  <johnsonb@ociweb.com>

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfoRepo.cpp:

          Added #if to prevent non-existent TAO1.4a file from being included.

Mon Feb 25 20:29:36 UTC 2008  Brian Johnson  <johnsonb@ociweb.com>

        * bin/dcps_tests.lst:

          Added restrictions to not run ImR test on CORBA_E_COMPACT and CORBA_E_MICRO.

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfoRepo.mpc:

          Added dependency on imr_client.

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfoRepo.cpp:

        * bin/dcps_tests.lst:

          Added Messenger_Imr test to nightly builds.

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfoRepo.cpp:

          Changed _narrow of info repo object to an _unchecked_narrow
          since in the case where we are using an Imr, the call goes
          to the Imr and back to us, which is wasteful and was currently
          causing an exception since the POAManager wasn't yet activated.

        * examples/DCPS/Messenger_Imr/run_test.pl:

          Made a change to the location that the tcp.conf file is
          expected at.  Also added passing in the conf file to the
          Info repo.

Thu Jan 31 20:22:48 UTC 2008  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/MultiRepoTest/TestConfig.cpp:

          Prefixed anonymous-namespace constant names with TC_ (Test Config)
          since DEFAULT_TYPE was conflicting with a macro on gcc 3.3/solaris.

Thu Jan 31 20:15:18 UTC 2008  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * bin/auto_run_tests.pl:

Thu Jul  5 22:21:50 UTC 2007  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        These changes intended to fix the bugs and work around limitations
        observered during sub_init_loop test debugging.

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Updated logging message to provide more detail infos.

        * dds/DCPS/WriteDataContainer.cpp:

          Added locking in unregister_all function to access the sending_data_
          list since the function may be called from the thread calling
          delete_datawriter which does not hold the lock in advance.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSet.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSet.cpp:

          Made the send_start() and remove_links() also acquire the
          lock in the provided DataLinkSet. This would fix the access
          violation when send_start is using the link while the link
          is removed from the DataLinkSet.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/RemoveAllVisitor.cpp:

          Fixed a bug in visit_element() that should pass true( data
          dropping is triggered by transport) to data_dropped () call
          instead of passing false (data dropping is triggered
          by datawriter via remove_sample() call).

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ReceiveListenerSet.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ReceiveListenerSet.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ReceiveListenerSet.cpp:

          Added get_keys() and exist() function to avoid the map iteration
          outside ReceiveListenerSet class scope.
          Added lock to protect the internal map to fix the access violation
          on the ReceiveListener object.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkCleanupTask.cpp:

          Applied the new functions defined in ReceiveListenerSet.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.cpp:

          Made the reconnect() function check if the send/receive strategy
          are reset to nil or not to avoid the access violation. If strategies
          are reset, a new strategy will be created.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy.cpp:

          Made the strategy hold a reference of the connection while
          receiving/sending to avoid the problem that the connection
          is destroyed while receiving/sending samples.
          Updated some logging messages to provide the function name.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.h:

          Added friendship with SimpleTcpDataLink so the
          connect_datalink() can be called in
          SimpleTcpDataLink::reconnect().

        * tests/DCPS/sub_init_loop/pub.ini:

          Made the publisher not try to reconnect to reduce the time
          period between connection tear down by the reconnect thread
          and association removing by the cleanup task thread.

        * tests/DCPS/sub_init_loop/run_test.pl:

          Extended the publisher timeout since the unregistering the
          datawriter may take longer.

        * tests/DCPS/sub_init_loop/subscriber.cpp:

          Added time delay for the datareader restart. This is a
          work around of the problem that the cleanup task removes
          the newly added associations and cause the datareader
          timeout on waiting for new connection. The real solution
          is to get a snapshot of the associations in the datalink
          at the time the reconnect attempt failed and the cleanup
          task should remove the associations based on the snapshot
          of the associations.

Thu Jul  5 22:21:49 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * README:

          Updated download URL.

Mon Jul  2 22:36:05 UTC 2007  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/DcpsIntegration/topic.cpp:

          Added sleep for 2 seconds to wait for all built in
          datareaders to receive the add_associations from InfoRepo
          before delete the subscriber. Otherwise the add_associations
          will not add the remote_id to the transport mapping
          and the remove_associations will fail to find the remote id.

          for RT 10955.

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest4_0/run_test.pl:

          Made test DCPSInfoRepo default to not turn on ORBDebugLevel.

          Removed unrequired methods.

        * DevGuideExamples/DCPS/Messenger/subscriber.cpp:
          Change variable name to generic transport type.

Fri Jun 29 21:14:07 UTC 2007  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        These changes are made to fix the view state.(See RT 10955)

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:

          Updated the read/take operations to update the view state
          after finishing read one instance instead of reading first
          sample and update the view state only when the most recent
          generation samples in the instance are read. The samples
          of same instance returned from single read() should have
          same view state.

        * dds/DCPS/InstanceState.h:
        * dds/DCPS/InstanceState.inl:

          Added method to check if a received sample belongs to current
          generation.

        * tests/DCPS/TransientLocalTest/run_test.pl:

          Made subscriber start 2 seconds after publisher send all samples to avoid
          the timing issue that the subscriber may start and finish in 1 second while
          the publisher is waiting for it to start until timeout. This should fix the
          TransientLocalTest test failure occassionally.

          Continued making tests compatible with static builds, especially with
          the old (1.4a) ACE svc config behavior where processing "dynamic"
          directives will yield an error when the dynamic library is not found,
          even if the service object is already in the ACE service repository.

        * dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/SubscriberImpl.cpp:

          Made the DataWriter/DataReader remove_all_association() calls
          before the un-registering from transport, otherwise some
          callbacks resulted from the un-registration will be lost.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:

          Made send strategy not try to send the graceful disconnect message
          when the terminate_send() is called due to a non-graceful disconnect
          before a graceful link shutdown.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:

          Added send strategy and receive strategy nil value checking to avoid
          access violation since the reconnect and handle_timeout may be
          called after connection is re-established and the send/recv strategies
          are reset to nil.

        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/run_test.pl:
        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/subscriber.cpp:

          Added a new option to indicate if the on_subscription_lost callback
          needs be verified. Whether the listener receives the callback depends
          on the timing of remove_association and the handle_timeout call
          on the passive connection. The bp_timeout test will not verify
          on_subscription_lost callback since the listener receives the
          callback randomly.

          in DCPSInfoRepo to generate unique id per DCPSInfoRepo instance
          instead of per domain. This would allow multiple domains in the
          same process(connect to the same DCPSInfoRepo instance) share the
          same transport.

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Added notes for repo id generation scheme change.

        * bin/dcps_tests.lst:

          Removed !STATIC from the majority of tests.  The changes below allow
          the tests to use SimpleTCP in a static build.  Later I'll go back and
          enable the other transports where needed.
          Also uncommented the tests/DCPS/BuiltInTopic/run_test.pl ignore_*
          tests since BuiltInTopics are now supported.  There is a bug with
          ignore_part but Yan will fix that shortly so for now we will see it
          as red on the scoreboard.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/dummyTCP/PerformanceTest.cpp:

          Moved "using namespace std" to the cpp file.  This can't go in the h
          file because it has unwanted side-effects in other compilation units
          that include the header.

        * DDS_TAO.mwc:

          Use ace.mpc since it is the only library

          The code demonstrates using a class to abstract DDS logic
          from application logic and using a publisher and subscriber
          to reference to the same topic but not associate with each other.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/InfoRepo_population/InfoRepo_population.mpc:

          Added an "after" to relate this file's *Idl project to the Sync_Idl
          project in ../Sync/Sync.mpc.  This is needed so that the SyncExtC.cpp
          and SyncC.h files have the correct relative timestamps in incremental
          builds.

          Various changes to fix the reconnect problem when publisher is
          getting restarted. Three are three problems identified and fixed.
          1. The test itself needs to call get_matched_subscriptions() to
             make sure the writer has correct handle before sending data.
          2. SendStrategy needs a reset function which resets the connection.
          3. The orb thread needs to check the connection before sending
             the FULLY_ASSOCIATED message to the publisher.

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:
        * bin/DCPS/HTemplate.pm:

          Moved the read* & take* precondition checks to a common function.
          Made sure to set owns(false) when zero-copy read/take is done.
          I also fixed that take_instance did not delete the sample when it
          took it -- Yan did this on Friday but I had not updated.

        * tests/DCPS/ZeroCopyRead/main.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/ZeroCopyRead/run_test.pl:

          Added the -i option to run with read_instance and take_instance
          methods. Cleaned up the test a bit.

          Added zero-copy sequence copy constructor test to test case 9.

        * tests/DCPS/ZeroCopyRead/run_test.pl:

          Removed a duplicate option from InfoRepo command line.

Fri Jun  1 23:31:01 UTC 2007  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:

          Fixed the problem that take_instance() implementation did not remove
          the sample from instance after read.
          Basically I rolled back the *DataReaderImpl::take_instance()
          implementation to the version before
          "Wed May 30 19:19:38 UTC 2007  Scott Harris  <harris_s@ociweb.com>"
          and merged the changes needed for zero copy.

          Turned off ORBDebugLevel for InfoRepo and removed duplicated command
          line options.

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:
        * bin/DCPS/HTemplate.pm:

          Renamed FooDataWriter::marshal() to dds_marshal() since marshal()
          conflicts with a method inherited from the stub (due to the local-
          interface implementation).

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          To maintain symmetry with dds_marhsal(), renamed demarshal() to
          dds_demarshal() and made it pure-virtual.

        * tests/DCPS/unit/MyTypeSupportImpl.h:

          Added dds_demarshal() since it's now pure-virtual in the base.

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:
        * bin/DCPS/HTemplate.pm:

          Added new virtual method release_instance to DCPS type
          DataReaderImpl that removes the instance with the provided
          handle from the instance - handle map.

        * bin/dcps_tests.lst:

          Added Liveliness tests.

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/InstanceState.h:
        * dds/DCPS/InstanceState.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/InstanceState.cpp:

          Corrected the DataReader liveliness implementation as stated
          in spec.
          Made the datareader check if an instance has no samples when
          it receives the dispose message or liveliness detection finds
          the writer is dead. If it is then the instance/handle will be
          removed from internal maps in DataReader.

        * tests/DCPS/LivelinessTest/run_test.pl:

          Fixed test to run with current DDS.

        * tests/DCPS/unit/MyTypeSupportImpl.h:

          Added implementation for pure virtual function
          release_instance_i() to avoid compilation error.

          Reverted back to the old version since the previous friendship

          object reference.

        * tests/DCPS/DCPSInfoRepo/test_helper.h:

          The test was failing trying to narrow DataWriter to DataWriterRemote,
          which is no longer possible.  Changed to use the "test_helper" to get
          the DataWriterRemote from the DataWriter.

          Simplified mpb and mpc files in the following ways:
            - don't refer to "orbsvcs" unless we really need it
            - "project(*)" becomes "project"
            - inhert "portableserver" in the base projects so not every user
                mpc file needs to mention it
            - "taoexe, dcps" becomes "dcpsexe"

          Adjusted IDL_Files and TypeSupport_Files sections so that IDL is only

          files is minimized.

          Fixed a bug where if there are two or more DCPS_DATA_TYPE structs in

         Added simple test for built in sequence support in DDS.
         It also covered other test cases:
           - Multiple DCPS types with built in sequences.
             This is to verify no link problem with built in
             sequences support.
           - DCPS struct contains sequence types defined
             in other module.

                        Updated tests, examples, and performance tests to the new changes in
                        DDS, including using local interfaces for listeners and dealing with
                        generated code being in the same namespace as the DCPS struct type.
                        The only tests that won't compile after these changes are those tests
                        that use handcrafted "type support" code instead of the generated
                        code or use internal library classes directly.  Those tests are
                        (by MPC project name): dcps_integration_infrastructure,
                        dcps_integration_topic, DcpsFooType, dcpsinfo_test_publisher,
                        dcpsinfo_test_subscriber, DcpsSimpleFooTest, and DdsDcps_UnitTest.

                        Changed TAO::DCPS::servant_to_reference() to increment the reference
                        count as it did before we switched to local interfaces.

                        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/DataReaderListener.cpp:

                        Removed #if code used to allow build
                        with old style <type>SZSeq type.

                        * dds/DCPS/LocalObject.h:

                        Reverted the change directly below this one.

        Wed May 23 21:00:59 UTC 2007  Scott Harris  <harris_s@ociweb.com>

                        * dds/DCPS/LocalObject.h:

                        Resolved a problem with reference counting.

                        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

                        Added more notes about servants vs object references.

                        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/DataReaderListener.cpp:
                        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/Writer.cpp:
                        * tests/DCPS/ZeroCopyRead/main.cpp:

                        Changed the tests to not use servants for the write and read calls.
                        There is no longer a performance benefit (thanks to local interfaces).
                        Added comments to that effect.

                        * tests/DCPS/unit/Main.cpp:

                        Changed all
                                                        PortableServer::ServantBase_var safe_servant = fts_servant;
                                        to
                                                TAO::DCPS::LocalObject_var safe_servant
                                        where appropriate.

                                        No others should be changed because they are POA servants
                                        and not local objects.

                        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

                        Removed support for --Module option from dcps_ts.pl.

                        * tests/DCPS/BuiltInTopic/main.cpp:

                        Adjusted the type specific interfaces from --Module Mine to
                        the type scope of Xyz to get this test to build.

                        template.  The second template argument should never be used at the

                        Same reference_to_servant change noted above, and began the process
                        of changing all tests and examples to work with the new local
                        interfaces and change in module for type-support, etc.

                        Whitespace formatting and removed ACE_dynamic_cast since it's
                        deprecated.

                        * tests/DCPS/FooType/FooType.idl:

                        Change to use local IDL interfaces.

                        * DDS_no_CORBA.mwc:

                        Added some tests that now compile with local interfaces.

                        * tests/DCPS/FooType4/DcpsFooType4.mpc:

                        Removed the --module from the dcps_ts.pl command line.  Not sure if
                        this change should be part of the merge back to trunk or if we should
                        change the code or if more changes need to be made to the --module
                        support.

                        * dds/DCPS/LocalObject.h:

                        Made TAO::DCPS::LocalObject into a class template so it can
                        disambiguate the multiply-inherited _ptr_type and _narrow members.

                        Fixed reference counting bugs in cases where the code assumed there
                        was a POA involved (what used to be non-local interfaces).

                        Updated the tests referenced by DDS_no_CORBA.mwc to compile with
                        these latest changes.

Fri May 25 17:10:53 UTC 2007  Ciju John  <johnc at ociweb dot com>

        * performance-tests/DCPS/InfoRepo_population/InfoRepo_population.mpc:
          Fixed incorrect project dependencies.

Fri May 25 16:46:08 UTC 2007  Ciju John  <johnc at ociweb dot com>

        * performance-tests/DCPS/InfoRepo_population/InfoRepo_population.mpc:
          Rename project to better reflect role.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Sync/Sync.mpc:
          Fix visibility issues.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Sync/SyncServer_i.cpp:
          Remove unused parameter.

Fri May 25 14:45:55 UTC 2007  Ciju John  <johnc at ociweb dot com>

        * performance-tests/DCPS/InfoRepo_population/InfoRepo_population.mpc:
          The publisher & subscribers need the SyncClient library. Using
          the 'after' MPC option to order the builds.

Thu May 24 16:31:08 UTC 2007  Ciju John  <johnc at ociweb dot com>

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Sync/Sync.mpc:
          This library shouldn't be built as part of a minimum_corba
          build. Using the MPC 'avoids' clause to add restriction.

Thu May 24 16:16:54 UTC 2007  Ciju John  <johnc at ociweb dot com>

        * performance-tests/DCPS/Sync/SyncServer_i.h:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/Sync/Sync_export.h:
          Fix for visibility related issue. The generated proxy classes
          don't have the export macros and therefore aren't visibile
          outside the Sync library. Fixed by adding dependency directly
          upon the idl file which pulls in the object files directly
          getting around the visibility restriction.

Wed May 23 15:42:48 UTC 2007  Ciju John  <johnc at ociweb dot com>

        * performance-tests/DCPS/InfoRepo_population/InfoRepo_population.mpc:
          This project is dependent upon the ../Sync libraries. Add
          dependency to serialize build.

Mon May 21 18:24:47 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * etc/dds.doxygen:

          Updated for Doxygen 1.5.  Thanks to Scott Harris for doing this.

Mon May 21 15:50:14 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/BuiltInTopicTest/monitor.cpp:

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:
        * README:

          Updated version numbers to reflect the forthcoming 0.13 release.

Fri May 18 19:26:02 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * DDS version 0_12 released.

Fri May 18 18:05:41 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/reliable_mcast.conf:

          Fixed config file.

        * DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/reliable_mcast.conf:
        * DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/sub_reliable_mcast.ini:

          Added configuration files for reliable multicast.

Fri May 18 15:08:29 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * bin/dcps_tests.lst:

          Added DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger using reliable multicast.

Fri May 18 14:51:25 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/publisher.cpp:
        * DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/run_test.pl:
        * DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/subscriber.cpp:

          Extended the DevGuideExample to work with reliable multicast.  Thanks
          to Ciju for actually doing this work.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/ReliableMulticast/ReliableMulticastTransportConfiguration.cpp:

          Read the configuration from the transport section of the ini file.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/ReliableMulticast/ReliableMulticastTransportImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/ReliableMulticast/ReliableMulticastTransportImpl.inl:
          Just like UDP, always report the transport as "acked" because the
          acknowledgement for connection establishment doesn't actually happen
          in reliable multicast.

Thu May 17 19:16:09 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Added a note on a work-around needed to properly build the tests with
          TAO 1.5a patch level "0".

Thu May 17 18:40:09 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Minor clarifications and removed contact info (email addrs) since
          it's now in README.

Thu May 17 18:17:51 UTC 2007  Scott Harris  <harris_s@ociweb.com>

        * ChangeLog:

          Fixed a reference to the previous ChangeLog.

        * DDS_info.txt:

          Added an example of using -DCPSInfoRepo.

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:
        * README:

          Corrected spelling errors.

Thu May 17 18:16:18 UTC 2007  Ciju John  <johnc at ociweb dot com>

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Add note regards reliable multicast default configuration
          status.

Thu May 17 15:28:44 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * README:

          Documented the current state of the tests.

Thu May 17 14:15:30 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * MPC/config/vc8_warnings.mpb:

          Moved vc8_warnings.mpb here instead of having it in config-legacy.

        * MPC/config-legacy:
        * MPC/config-legacy/README.txt:
        * MPC/config-legacy/vc8_warnings.mpb:

Thu May 17 13:55:59 UTC 2007  Ciju John  <johnc at ociweb dot com>

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:
          Add entry about InfoRepo persistence mechanism.

Wed May 16 21:39:59 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/WriteDataContainer.cpp(unregister_all):

          Added a check for a NULL DataSampleListElement in sending_data_.  The
          sub_init_loop stress test has shown a segfault here.

Wed May 16 20:05:37 UTC 2007  Byron Harris  <harris_b@ociweb.com>

        * README:

          Removed spell checker content brought over from the release notes.

Wed May 16 19:27:14 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/BuiltInTopicTest/run_test.pl:
        * tests/DCPS/BuiltInTopic/run_test.pl:

          When -Config STATIC is used, don't use -ORBSvcConf tcp.conf since it
          uses dynamic loading.

        * tests/DCPS/BuiltInTopicTest/BuiltInTopicTest.mpc:

        * tests/DCPS/BuiltInTopicTest/publisher.cpp:

          Linked with SimpleTCP so that static builds can work too.

Wed May 16 19:24:12 UTC 2007  Scott Harris  <harris_s@ociweb.com>

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:
        * README:

          Removed obsolete notes and made other improvements.

Wed May 16 18:09:17 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/DCPSInfoRepo/run_test.pl:

          Increased timeout to be more tolerant of slow machines, fixed logic
          errors in the perl script (using an uninitialized variable).

Wed May 16 17:46:01 UTC 2007  Byron Harris  <harris_b@ociweb.com>

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:
        * README:

          Moved content in the release notes not related to changes
          between releases to the README.

Wed May 16 17:42:27 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/debug.cpp:

          Added newline at end of file to avoid warning from gcc.

          Layout changes. Remove comments.

Wed May 16 15:09:05 UTC 2007  Scott Harris  <harris_s@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/debug.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/debug.h:
        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.cpp:

          Create a function to set the DCPS_debug_level.

Tue May 15 19:39:55 UTC 2007  Ciju John  <johnc at ociweb dot com>

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfoRepo.cpp:
          Rename variables to descriptive names.

        * dds/InfoRepo/PersistenceUpdater.cpp:
          removed couple of debug messages.

Tue May 15 15:47:07 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/DcpsIntegration/run_test-integration.pl:
        * tests/DCPS/TransientLocalTest/run_test.pl:
        * tests/DCPS/unit/run_test.pl:

          Removed redirection of STDOUT and STDERR streams in Perl.  This turns
          out to be incompatible with a Perl process in Windows that itself has
          its output or error streams redirected to files.  Instead we now use
          -ORBLogFile to redirect test error/log messages to a file.

Tue May 15 04:01:27 UTC 2007  Scott Harris  <harris_s@ociweb.com>

        * DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger_ZeroCopy/DataReaderListener.cpp:

          Update per updates to the Dev. Guide.

Mon May 14 18:55:09 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/unit/Main.cpp:

          Use ACE_Time_Value to compare times in order to hide platform
          differences in signed/unsigned time values.

Mon May 14 17:57:07 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcp.cpp:

          Reinstated a corrected version of the change that was reverted in...
          Sun May 13 21:53:00 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * docs/INSTALL:

          Updated installation instructions.

Sun May 13 21:53:00 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcp.cpp:

          Partially reverted the change from...
          Fri May 11 14:01:18 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>
          ...since even though it worked for static builds, it broke many of
          the shared-library builds.

Sun May 13 21:10:38 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * etc/dds.doxygen:

          Fixed the Doxygen config to pick up all library source files.

Fri May 11 16:25:43 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * etc:
        * etc/dds.doxygen:

          Added a Doxygen configuration file for DDS.

Fri May 11 14:41:01 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * bin/dcps_tests.lst:

          Re-enabled the Reconnect test.

        * tests/DCPS/TransientLocalTest/run_test.pl:
        * tests/DCPS/unit/run_test.pl:

          Reverted some of my changes from...
          Thu May 10 14:50:47 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>
          ...it turns out that the redirected STDERR or STDOUT needs to be
          closed before STDERR or STDOUT is re-opened.  The part of yesterday's
          change that remains is that the "saved" streams are not closed.

Fri May 11 14:01:18 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        Changes to allow BIT functionality in static builds (for now anyway,
        BIT always uses SimpleTCP as its transport implementation).

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcp.cpp:

          Initialize the Loader object in the ACE Service Configurator.

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfoRepo.cpp:
        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfoRepo.mpc:
        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfoRepo_bits.mpb:

          Link the SimpleTCP library and initialize it as long as the MPC
          feature built_in_topics = 1.

        * tests/DCPS/BuiltInTopic/BuiltInTopic.mpc:
        * tests/DCPS/BuiltInTopic/main.cpp:

          Modified to work in static builds.

Thu May 10 14:50:47 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/BuiltInTopicTest/run_test.pl:
        * tests/DCPS/DcpsIntegration/run_test-integration.pl:

        * tests/DCPS/TransientLocalTest/run_test.pl:
        * tests/DCPS/unit/run_test.pl:

          Test scripts that redirect stdout or stderr need to not close the
          file handles after the redirection is done.  This prevents the
          remainder of the script from producing output.

Wed May 09 22:46:51 UTC 2007  Scott Harris  <harris_s@ociweb.com>

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:
        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.h:
        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Cleanup of zero-copy implementation per review.

        * DDS_info.txt:

          Add note on what it looks like when the TCP transport library is unavailable.

        * tests/DCPS/Messenger_ZeroCopy:
        * bin/dcps_tests.lst:

          Moved tets/DCPS/Messenger_ZeroCopy to
              DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger_ZeroCopy.
          And removed it from the nightly build tests because it
          is an example and the ZeroCopyRead test is a true test.

        * DDS_zero-copy.mwc:

          Removed DDS_zero-copy.mwc becuase it was temporary.

Wed May  9 15:52:21 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Continued documenting changes since 0.11 was released.

Wed May  9 15:23:33 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/DCPSInfoRepo/run_test.pl:

          Pass -NOBITS on the DCPSInfoRepo command line since this test doesn't
          use BITS.  This makes the test compatible with static builds.

Wed May  9 14:02:02 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/BuiltInTopicTest/monitor.cpp:

          Use unsigned ints to eliminated signed/unsigned mismatch warnings.

Wed May  9 13:48:26 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * docs/INSTALL:

          Added some information on supported platforms and building DDS.

Tue May 08 23:41:25 UTC 2007  Trevor Fields  <fields_t@ociweb.com>

        * performance-tests/DCPS/SimpleLatency/PubListener.cpp:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/SimpleLatency/PubListener.h:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/SimpleLatency/sample_pub.cpp:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/SimpleLatency/sample_sub.cpp:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/SimpleLatency/SubListener.cpp:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/SimpleLatency/SubListener.h:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPProfilingTest/common.h:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPProfilingTest/DataReaderListener.cpp:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPProfilingTest/DataReaderListener.h:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPProfilingTest/subscriber.cpp:

          Added option to use Zero copy read.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPProfilingTest/run_test-1p1s.pl:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPProfilingTest/run_test-1p4s.pl:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPProfilingTest/run_test-2p3s.pl:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPProfilingTest/run_test-4p1s.pl:

          Changed to disable Built In Topic usage.

Tue May  8 19:12:09 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.h:
        * dds/DCPS/WriteDataContainer.h:
        * dds/DCPS/WriteDataContainer.cpp:

          Removed ACE_THROW_SPEC(()) clauses from functions that aren't
          overrides of skeleton functions.  ACE_THROW_SPEC is not necessary and
          causes problems on platforms that check exceptions against the
          throw() clause.  In this case, we saw test failures because
          servant_to_reference didn't declare CORBA::UserException even though,
          as the comments indicated, it can throw POA::ObjectNotActive and
          other user exceptions.  The common C++ point of view these days is
          that throw() clauses are more trouble than they're worth.

Tue May  8 16:09:44 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * rules.dds.GNU:

          Added the default value (1) for built_in_topics.

Tue Apr 24 18:41:35 UTC 2007 Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DomainParticipantImpl.cpp:

          Added 2 seconds delay after participant creates the built-in-topic
          datareaders. This is a work around for the problem of the
          built-in-topic data lost during fully association period. We need
          find a better solution to synchronize the bit data publishing and
          subscribering.

Thu Apr 19 20:22:30 UTC 2007 Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.cpp:

          Rolled back part of changes in last commit - moved
          the send() call inside the lock since it could cause
          deadlock situation when there are multiple datawriters with
          multiple writing threads in a process. The deadlock situation
          happens when first writing thread calls send_start(), second
          writing thread calls send_start(), first writing thread calls
          send_stop() which hold the lock in DataLinkSet and calls second
          datawriter data_delivered(), the second datawriter holds its
          writer's lock and stuck on acquiring the lock in DataLinkSet.

          Moved the send() call outside the lock since the
          TransportInterface::send() is thread safe and
          added another parameter to data_available() to avoid
          duplicate code of resend_data_available() from

        * dds/DdsDcpsInfrastructure.idl:
          Use Long (instead of int) in IDL files.

Wed Apr 18 16:25:09 UTC 2007  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        These main changes are fixing the built-in-topics bugs and
        supporting TRANSIENT_LOCAL_DURABILITY_QOS.

        *  bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:

           Made dispose ignore the case of bit sample not registered
           since it could hanppen.

        *  dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfoRepo.cpp:

          Made poa_manager activate() called before initialize bit.
          Otherwise a TRANSIENT exception will be caught.

        *  dds/InfoRepo/DCPS_IR_Domain.cpp:

          Made the built-in-topic datawriter use the
          TRANSIENT_LOCAL_DURABILITY_QOS instead of using the
          TransientKludge. However, the TransientKludge is still
          be used for other purpose such as using that so the
          domainparticipant in DCPSInfoRepo will not create the
          bit datareader. We may need rename it.

        *  dds/DCPS/DataSampleList.cpp:
        *  dds/DCPS/DataSampleList.inl:
        *  dds/DCPS/DataSampleList.h:

          Made the next_send_sample_/previous_send_sample link isolated
          from the next_sample_/previous_sample link. When
          inserting/deleting DataSampleElement to one of the links will
          not change the other link.
          Added sub list to the DataSampleElement to support the
          transient local qos. The DataSampleElement defaults to have
          0 subs which means it will be sent to all datalinks
          otherwise it will be sent to the specified subscribers.

        *  dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.h:
        *  dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          - Added bit flag.
          - Added RepoId->InstanceHandler map to cache the info retrieved
            upon add_association any operation after will look the cache
            to get the instance handler such as for listener callback. This
            will solve the problem that remove_association will fail look
            up the bit information.
          - Fixed a bug that does not synchronize the reference counting
            on datareader servant. This causes access violation on TCPListener
            test sometimes.

        *  dds/DCPS/WriteDataContainer.cpp:
        *  dds/DCPS/WriteDataContainer.h:

          - Made all internal list(unsent, sending, released, sent) using
            next_send_sample/previous_send_sample link, instance sample list
            and waiting instance sample list using next_instance_sample link
            and added the sample_holder which uses next_sample/previous sample
            link to hold all samples by the order of write.
          - Supported reenqueue_all to specified subscribers.

        *  dds/DCPS/transport/simpleUnreliableDgram/SimpleMcastTransport.cpp:

           Corrected the class name in a debug message.

        *  dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.h:
        *  dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSetMap.h:
        *  dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:
        *  dds/DCPS/transport/framework/RepoIdSetMap.h:
        *  dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.inl:
        *  dds/DCPS/transport/framework/RepoIdSet.cpp:
        *  dds/DCPS/transport/framework/RepoIdSetMap.cpp:
        *  dds/DCPS/transport/framework/RepoIdSet.h:
        *  dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSet.h:
        *  dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportInterface.inl:
        *  dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSetMap.cpp:
        *  dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSet.cpp:
        *  dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.cpp:

           - Supported the samples to send to specific datareaders
           - Fixed a problem that the publisher fully association expect the
             same repo set received as in pending association set. This will
             fail when the subscriber creates multiple datareaders to the
             same topic. The pending association set should be a subset of the
             fully association info from subscriber instead of exact same.

        *  dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportFactory.h:
        *  dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportFactory.cpp:

          Made the TransportFactory create a new reactor for different
          transport instance. With a single reactor thread, the input of
          one transport will be blocked while another transport is handling
          input. This would solve the problem that lookup instance handle
          by repo id fail via built-in-topic datareader during
          fully_association.

        *  dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:
        *  dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.h:

          - Supported TRANSIENT_LOCAL_QOS on datawriter. The datawriter
            will resend all current sending and sent samples to the new
            associated datareaders.
          - Added RepoId->InstanceHandler map to cache the info retrieved
            upon add_association any operation after will look the cache
            to get the instance handler such as for listener callback. This
            will solve the problem that remove_association will fail look
            up the bit information.

        *  dds/DCPS/BuiltInTopicUtils.h:

           Changed the fail return to RETCODE_ERROR.

        *  dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.cpp:
        *  dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.h:

           Made the built-in-topic defaults be on and removed the set_BIT().
           Supported -DCPSBit option in command line and also in DCPS config.
           The commandline option will overwrite the DCPS configuration.

        *  dds/DCPS/Qos_Helper.inl:
        *  dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.h:
        *  dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.cpp:

           Supported TRANSIENT_LOCAL_QOS.

        *  dds/DCPS/SubscriberImpl.cpp:

          Fixed a deadlock situation that the reactor thread and the
          thread calling delete_participant acquire locks in reverse
          order. The two involved locks are the si_lock_ in SubscriberImpl
          and the token_ in ACE_Select_Reactor_T. The thread calling
          delete_participant holds the lock in SubscriberImpl and tries
          to acquire lock in select reactor to remove handler while the
          reactor thread is handling an event which holds the lock in reactor.
          The reactor thread delieved the sample to datareader and insert
          the datareader to the subscriber internal cotainer which acquire
          the lock in SubscriberImpl. Since the lock in SubscriberImpl protects
          the internal data structure, to fix this problem, the lock scope
          in SubscriberImpl was adjusted so that the datareader will not hold
          the lock while calling remove_all_associations().

          Configured the tests either run with the bit on or
          off.
          - All performance tests defaults to run with non-bit.
            The TCPListenerTest has option to run with bit.
            e.g. run "run_test-1p4s.pl bit"
          - Some tests that the bit is not applicable.
            e.g. FooTest3_0, FooTest3_1 and FooTest3_2
          - The new tests are run with non-bit.
            e.g. tests/Messenger_Imr/run_test.pl

Tue Mar 27 19:13:03 UTC 2007  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * tests/DCPS/Serializer/SerializerTest.cpp:

          Changed some long double assignments, passed as an array
          of chars, for platforms where the size of the long
          double is less than 16 bytes, to use signed chars
          (7 bits) for all array values, where in each case
          half the previous values were using all 8 bits. This
          change eliminates warnings on platforms/compilers
          where char is a signed type, for example Windows/vc8.

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest4_0/Reader.cpp:

        * DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/run_test.pl:
          Add debug messages.

        * tests/DCPS/BuiltInTopic/main.cpp:
          Remove empty line.

        * tests/DCPS/Messenger_Imr/run_test.pl:
          No need for a timed kill. A timed kill produces an error message
          which threw havoc on the nightly test run.

        * bin/auto_run_tests.pl:

          When running an executable directly (no run_test.pl), we need to take
          into account the -ExeSubDir setting.

        * tests/DCPS/Messenger_Imr/pub.ini:

        * DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/run_ns_test.pl:

          The nsadd binary needs to be found in $ACE_ROOT/bin.  The fact that
          it's also in $TAO_ROOT/utils/nslist is just a side-effect of the GNU
          make build system.

          used for this test.

        * tests/DCPS/Messenger_ZeroCopy/Messenger.mpc:
        * tests/DCPS/Messenger_ZeroCopy/Messenger_ZeroCopy.mpc:

          Renamed this file from Messenger.mpc to Messenger_ZeroCopy.mpc since
          MPC project names must be unique in the workspace and project names
          are derived from the name of the .mpc file.

        * bin/auto_run_tests.pl:

          Added the -l command-line option, used to specify an alternate file
          containing the test list.
          When using the -s option (sandbox), don't assume that the target test
          is a Perl script, it may be an executable.  Files ending in .pl are
          assumed to be Perl scripts, otherwise they will be treated as
          executables.
          Also, removed code specific to ACE tests.

          Added a reliable multicast transport from the ReliableMulticast
          branch, merging revisions 450 through 528 from that branch into
          the trunk.  This transport has the same basic configuration
          parameters as the unreliable multicast transport, but adds the
          following:

            sender_history_size - How many packets to buffer for potential
              retransmission
            receiver_buffer_size - How large a buffer to keep on the receiving
              side to handle reordering, late delivery, etc.

          This transport introduces fragmentation and re-assembly logic so
          from the perspective of the transport framework it appears that
          a receiver is joining a UDP stream already in progress.

          When an unrecoverable fault is detected, the transport currently
          sets the disconnected flag.  This should eventually be configurable
          through QoS parameters.

          In the change logged at
          Wed Feb  7 16:38:18 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>
          I forgot to change the "after +=" lines of the MPC file to match the
          new project name.

Wed Feb 14 17:27:00 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * MPC/config/built_in_topic_support.mpb:

          Fixed whitespace.

        * MPC/config/dcps.mpb:
        * MPC/config/dds_suppress_any_support.mpb:
        * dds/dcps_bits.mpb:

          Earlier versions of TAO (such as 1.4a) don't work properly with the
          tao_idl -Sa -St options.  This check-in provides an MPC feature that
          will be used to turn on or off the -Sa -St options.

        * dds/DCPS/DomainParticipantImpl.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/BuiltInTopic/main.cpp:

          Eliminate "unused parameter" warnings.

Tue Feb 13 23:00:56 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * MPC/config/dcps.mpb:
        * dds/dcps_bits.mpb:

          Default to call tao_idl with -Sa and -St arguments to suppress
          generation of CORBA Any and Typecode operations.

        * dds/DdsDcpsInfrastructure.idl:
        * dds/DdsDcpsPublication.idl:
        * dds/DdsDcpsSubscription.idl:

          Place Built-in Topic specific code within #ifndef DDS_MINIMUM_BIT so
          that even more is excluded from the build when the MPC feature
          built_in_topics is zero.

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          As a consequence of the above IDL changes, the
          get_matched_{publication,subscription}_data() operations are not
          available in a built_in_topics=0 build.  Before this change the
          operations were present but returned an "unsupported" error code.

Tue Feb 13 17:45:11 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/BuiltInTopic/common.h:
        * tests/DCPS/BuiltInTopic/common.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/BuiltInTopic/main.cpp:

          Added a way for main() to inform common.cpp that the transports need
          to be unloaded.  Without this the transports would attempt to unload
          after main() completes (due to static destructors).  The transports
          can't unload after main() completes because the dynamic libraries
          that implement that transports have already been unloaded.

        * tests/DCPS/BuiltInTopic/run_test.pl:

          Since SimpleTCP is now a separate library, need to enable the
          -ORBSvcConf argument to load it.

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfoRepo.mpc:
        * dds/dcps_bits.mpb:

          Added the ability to build without built-in topic support as an MPC
          feature.  To use, run mwc.pl like so (from $DDS_ROOT):
                  mwc.pl -type gnuace -features built_in_topics=0 DDS.mwc
          Alternatively, add "built_in_topics=0" to default.features within
          $ACE_ROOT/bin/MakeProjectCreator/config (the former method is
          preferred so that we don't have DDS-specific modifications within the
          ACE source tree).

          Also, cleaned up the various mpb and mpc files to simplify things.

        * dds/DCPS/TypeSupportImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/TypeSupportImpl.cpp:

          Removed these files.  They were not used by the project.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/*.{h,cpp,inl}
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleUnreliableDgram/*.{h,cpp,inl}:

          Normalized all #include preprocessor directives to have exactly one
          space after the #include.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/*.{h,cpp,inl}:

          Normalized all #include preprocessor directives to have exactly one
          space after the #include.  Also, enabled PCH for SimpleTCP since it
          was still referencing dds/DCPS from one it used to be part of that
          library.

        * DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/Messenger.mpc:

          Made the project names consistent (DDS_Messenger_idl instead of
          Messenger_idl).

        * tests/DCPS/BuiltInTopic/run_test.pl:

          Load the SimpleTCP library via svc.conf.

          Minor modifications.

Wed Feb  7 16:38:18 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/Messenger.mpc:

          Added "after" clauses to ensure that the client and server are not
          built until the IDL-generated files are in place.  This .mpc file
          should be the "gold standard" of how to use MPC with DDS.  It factors
          out the common IDL tasks so that the client and server projects can
          be run in parallel (VC8 and GNU make -j) without errors.

Wed Feb  7 16:01:49 UTC 2007  Ciju John  <johnc@ociweb.com>

Mon Feb  5 18:04:11 UTC 2007  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest5/run_test.pl:

          Added SimpleTcp service config to mixed_trans test to load the
          SimpleTcp library. This would fix the mixed transport test failure.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpLoader.cpp:

          Added transport type checking and print error if an incorrent type
          provided by service config file.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleUnreliableDgram/SimpleUnreliableDgramLoader.cpp:

          Updated incorrect type error message to have ERROR keyword to be easy for
          debugging.

Mon Feb  5 16:24:06 UTC 2007  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * bin/dcps_tests.lst:

          Fixed a bug that the FULLY_ASSOCIATION message serialize
          stream contains size_t data. Since size_t is platform
          dependent, this makes the FULLY_ASSOCIATION message
          deserialized incorrectly in the inter-host test. Replacing
          size_t with CORBA::ULong fixed the problem.

          Merged SimpleUdp and SimpleMcast transport together in SimpleUnreliableDgram library.
          The -type parameter in service configuration specifies which transport will register
          with the transport factory. A process can register both "SimpleUdp" and "SimpleMcast"
          or one of the two transports via service configuration.

        * DCPS/transport/framework/TransportDefs.h:

          Added two default id for SimpleMcast, one for subscriber (DEFAULT_SIMPLE_MCAST_SUB_ID)
          and one for publisher (DEFAULT_SIMPLE_MCAST_PUB_ID).

        * DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpGenerator.h:
        * DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpGenerator.cpp:

          Added default_transport_ids() function to support multiple default transport
          ids configuration registration and added transport id parameter to new_configuration()
          to provide different default configurations for the transport.

        * DCPS/transport/framework/TransportFactory.h:
        * DCPS/transport/framework/TransportFactory.cpp:

          Removed the default transport id parameter from the register_generator (). The default
          ids will be provided by generator via default_transport_ids(). Upon the transport library
          loading, the default transport configurations will be created and registered with the
          transport factory.

        * MPC/config/dcpsexe_with_unreliable_dgram.mpb:

          The "max_output_pause_period" configuration is added to

          for longer than this period then the socket will be closed

          Added backpressure detection and handling. The backpressure is
          observed with a "resource temporary unavailable" error. The same
          mechanism as in SimpleTcp is used to detect the backpressure.
          Upon backpressure, the samples will be queued to the send strategy
          internal queue and wait for resource available and then send.

          This test was randomly failing on some platforms because it
          depended upon hard-cast time-outs. The changes make the test
          more flexible and deterministic.

          Fixed the test failures on windows. It appears that we should not
          specify the local_address for the publisher, it should use the
          default value, otherwise the subscriber will not receive the
          samples.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleMCAST/SimpleMcastSocket.inl:

          Fixed the mcast test failure on windows. The receiver should
          call join() to the mcast group instead of just open with the
          mcast socket with the mcast group address.

          transport after created the SimpleMcast transport. However, this
          is not the problem that mcast does not work on windows build.

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.h:
        Re-worked the servant_to_reference function template in two ways:
        A. Simplified template parameters so that they can always be deduced
        from the argument passed in (pointer-to-servant).
        B. Used explicit activation on the POA instead of implicit activation
        this makes the DDS implementation compatible with CORBA/e-compact.
        Please from now on, only use explicit activation of servants.  If you
        are going to activate on the root POA of DDS's ORB (the normal case),
        then just call TAO::DCPS::servant_to_reference() -- it will return the
        typed _ptr.

          This is a kludge to fix the default SimpleUdp transport configuration
          problem. Use DISCOVER_UNIQUE_PORT_KLUDGE macro to guard the kludge

        * dds/DCPS/WriteDataContainer.cpp:
          In situations of repeated connection restablishment
          from the subscriber, we seem to get some orphan messages
          left behind in the system. When the system shuts down
          due to the cleanup mechanism now in place we enter a
          for-ever loop.
          The problem is most probably due to missing error handling
          somewhere in the element delivery path and fixing that is the
          real solution as otherwise over time the internal buffers will
          just fill up (currently only observed upon connection disruption).
          For now I am putting this code which will trap and cleanup these
          orphan messages at shutdown time.

          Added a multicast transport to DDS.  This is an unreliable
          transport and has 3 configuration parameters of interest,
          local_address_, multicast_group_address_, and receiver_.

          See the FooTest5 changes for information about how to configure
          publishers and subscribers to use multicast.

          Fixed a problem that the *TypeSupportImpl::get_type_name ()
          always returns the default type name (interface repository id).
          It should returns the name actually registered either from
          the user (via register_type) or the default type name
          (interface repository id).

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:

          Fixed the recursively acquiring non-recursive lock problem
          in remove_all_control_msgs (). To fix it, move the lock
          from remove_sample_i() to the caller functions.

          Made the terminate_send() called before send graceful
          disconnect message in
          SimpleTcpDataLink::send_graceful_disconnect_message() and
          made TransportSendStrategy::suspend_send() not reset the
          suspend state when it's already in terminate state. This
          should fix some race condition when terminate_send() is
          called before sending disconnect message.

          Added default transport id (TransportIdType) parameter to
          register_generator() so the transport configuation with
          the default transport ID (DEFAULT_SIMPLE_TCP_ID or
          DEFAULT_SIMPLE_UDP_ID) will be registered.

Tue Jan  2 22:43:33 UTC 2007  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest4_0/main.cpp:

          Removed the reference of the reader_transport_impl and
          writer_transport_impl before shutdown the transport.
          This would fix access violation on windows.

Wed Dec 20 16:29:36 UTC 2006  Ciju John  <johnc@ociweb.com>

Tue Dec 19 16:53:06 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/subscriber.cpp:

          Made subscriber wait for 5 seconds (>passive_reconnect_duration)
          to give transport time to detect the connection lost due to
          backpressure timeout before shutdown the datareader. This should fix
          the bp_timeout test failure on not receiving the subscription lost
          callback.

Tue Dec 19 15:58:47 UTC 2006  Ciju John  <johnc@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DdsDcpsInfrastructure.idl:
          Include a TAO IDL to bypass a vc71/vc8/intel c++ issue with base
          template export.

Mon Dec 18 18:10:11 UTC 2006  Ciju John  <johnc@ociweb.com>

Fri Dec 15 22:24:07 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DomainParticipantImpl.cpp:

          Made the topic object reference removed from map after deactivated
          from poa.  This would fix access violation in FooTest5 (during
          DomainParticipantImpl::delete_contained_entities()).

          needed to build the TAO_DDS middleware and put them
          in a single build.

Fri Dec  8 22:31:28 UTC 2006  Ciju John  <johnc@ociweb.com>

        The DataWriter & DataReader Listener now have an additional
          callback API 'on_connection_deleted'. This gets invoked when the

          Cleaning up debugging messages.

Fri Dec  8 19:38:39 UTC 2006  Ciju John  <johnc@ociweb.com>

          Rework thread-per-connection (TPC) to be able to remove
          transitions elements in the tpc queue. This was contributed by
          Yan Dai (dai_y@ociweb.com) to fix potential memory leaks in TPC

          up correctly.

Thu Dec  7 15:18:32 UTC 2006  Ciju John  <johnc@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:
          New API release_resources (called by concrete transport
          object upon DataLink disconnection). This just forwards the
          message to the TransportImpl object.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkCleanupTask.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkCleanupTask.cpp:
          A dedicated task belonging to the TransportImpl object. The
          TransportImpl adds safe (ref counted) DataLinks to the task. The
          task then cleans up any resources associated with the
          DataLink. This mechanism (top level dedicated thread) was
          preffered as we were able to reuse most of the
          remove_association logic even though the triger is comming up
          from the transport-specific ReConnection logic.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportControlElement.cpp:
          Initialize the TransportControlElement with loan count of 1
          (instead of 0 as before). This is because the Control Element is
          to be sent to only one DataLink.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportDebug.h:
          Change Default debug level to 1.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.cpp:
          Change find_publication/find_subscription API to optionally
          return a safe copy (ref incremented) of the target
          DataWriter/DataReader. This prevents the DataWriter getting
          wipped out during a send.
          New API release_link_resources (called by shutdown
          DataLink). This bumps up the DataLink ref count and adds it to
          the DataLinkCleanup task (which in turn cleans up DataLink
          resources).

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportQueueElement.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportQueueElement.inl:
          Change variable names to better reflect usage. Also take out the
          loan count assert in production code.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:
          Fix race condition in 'send_delayed_notifications'. The delayed
          notification count was being read outside the guard. This could
          change before guard acquisition. Now the read is done after
          guard acquisition.
          Change clear API to accept an optional next SendMode. The
          default is still MODE_DIRECT.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConfiguration.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConfiguration.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConfiguration.cpp:
          New configuration option 'passive_connect_duration' to set
          timeout on initial passive connection establishment. Setting
          this prevents deadlock when the InfoRepo directs us to connect
          with a bogus/dead publisher.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:
          The reconnect task gets cleaned up in the Connection object
          destructor, no need for shutdown() to cleanup. The shutdown
          cleanup was a temporary fix (for cleaning threads) to deal with
          subscriber crashes. Now we have a dedicated top-level thread to
          cleanup any associated DataLink resources upon subscriber
          crash. This will cleanup the Connection object as well as the
          associated Reconnect task.
          Added new API (called by the reconnect task) to inform the
          DataLink regards loss of its connection.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.cpp:
          Fix race-condition in sending graceful disconnect message. If
          mode is 'queue', the heap element will get queued and a race
          begins as to which thread (worker thread/ORB thread) will delete
          the element. Now DataLink gets terminated right after sending
          the graceful disconnect message. Once the DataLink is
          terminated the worker thread bows out of the race and the
          element can be safely deleted by the original creator (ORB
          thread).

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.cpp:
          Add entry-exit debug macro

        * dds/DCPS/RcObject_T.h:

Tue Nov 14 15:36:59 UTC 2006  Rich Seibel<seibel_r@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy.cpp:

          An array can not be allocated with a non-static constant (except
          with gcc).  We use a vector instead of an array.

          Add locks to protect shared data.
          Better usage of locks and reference counting, rather than hold
          locks for extended invocations.
          In TransportSendStrategy set DELAY_NOTIFICATION to be default
          for direct_send(). This could delay things a bit in the normal
          case but doing an immediate notification has been observed to
          deadlock in the DCPS layer in stress conditions. This occurs
          when the data_deliverd () call winds its way from the transport
          to DCPS layer while another thread is winding its way up.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSetMap.cpp:
          Renamed lock_ to map_lock_ to make it self-documenting.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/EntryExit.h:
          The EntryExit class does a run-time check before initializing
          any data members.
          Use a set size array, rather than ACE_CString data members.
          Defined a set of macros for logging levels. This allows logs
          above a sepecified level to be compiled out. This coupled with
          the run-time check should speed up things. The new design tries
          to minimize the performnace hit of logging.

          initialization.

Mon Sep 11 07:13:48 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:

        Fixed a problem that send or send_stop could happen after the datalink
        call send strategy to clear samples when keep_link=1.

      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportInterface.cpp:

        Fixed a problem that the send_start could send on a nil datalink.
        The problem is the send() could find the local_id with an empty
        datalink set because a datalink insertion to local_map_ was completed
        by two calls in add_associations().
            this->local_map_.find_or_create_set()
            local_set->insert_link()
        To fix this problem, the two calls above was replaced by a single
        call this->local_map_.insert_link().

      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ThreadPerConnectionSendTask.h:

        Made remove_sample() and remove_all_control_msgs() not handled by
        the thread per connection task. This would avoid the access violation
        when the data_delivered is called after sample is moved to release_data
        list and before send strategy remove_sample() is called.

      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:

        Made data_delievered/data_dropped call delayed in a few places to handle
        the writer lock and send strategy lock acquired in reverse order when
        thread_per_connection is enabled.
        Fixed a bug in send_stop() that cause crash when the header_.length > 0
        but elems_ is empty.
        Fixed a bug in remove_sample() that should return when the sample is removed
        from queue.

        on gcc compiler.

Wed Sep  7 06:59:35 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

      The main changes are: (See RT8999)
        - Made the DCPS entity servants deleted upon delete_*()
          call instead of upon orb shutdown. This would make the create/delete
          DCPS entity multiple times in a single process without shutdown
          Service Participant.
        - Added keep_link configuration to indicate whether a datalink should
          be maintained when all associations are removed. This would allow
          the datareader/datawriter reconnect repeatedly using the same
          connection.

      * dds/DCPS/WriteDataContainer.cpp:
      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSet.cpp:

        Added logging for cached allocator information.

      * dds/DCPS/DomainParticipantFactoryImpl.cpp:
      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.cpp:

        Added guard to protect unregistration of subscription.

      * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.cpp:

        Made send_graceful_disconnect_message() call notify the
        send strategy terminate send except the graceful disconnect
        message.

      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.h:
      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:
      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.inl:

        Made the release_reservations() not release datalink when
        all associations are removed if keep_link is configured to be on.
        Made the remove_sample() and remove_all_control_msgs_i() handled
        by ThreadPerConnectionSendTask when thread_per_connection is
        enabled. This makes the send() and remove_sample() be handled
        sequentially.

      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportConfiguration.h:
      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportConfiguration.cpp:
      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportConfiguration.inl:

        Added a new configuration - "keep_link", which indicates if the
        data link should be maintained when all associations are removed.
        The default value (0) means the link will be released as the
        last association is removed from the link.

      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:

        Added delayed_notification_mode_ status so the delayed notification
        will know if it's a data_delievered or data_dropped.
        Added clear() function to clean up the elements referenced by this
        datalink. This would let the datalink be reused when keep_link is
        on.

      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/QueueTaskBase_T.h:

        Commented error log when the dequeue_head failed.
        I'm not sure why this thread got more signals than actual signals

        send requests without interval.

      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ThreadPerConnectionSendTask.h:
      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ThreadPerConnectionSendTask.cpp:

      * dds/DCPS/Cached_Allocator_With_Overflow_T.h:

        Corrected a logging message.

      * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.h:

        Added deactivate_object template function so the delete_* can
        call it to deactivate the object from poa and cause the deletion
        of the servant.

      * dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.cpp:
      * dds/DCPS/SubscriberImpl.cpp:
      * dds/DCPS/DomainParticipantImpl.cpp:

        Added deactivate_object() call in delete_*() functions.

        Added keep_link configuration.

      * DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/subscriber.cpp:
      * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/subscriber.cpp:

        Removed the get_matched_publications() call since datareader
        servant is destroyed when delete_datareader() is called.

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:

          Corrected number of chunks for message block allocator in a
          logging message.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.cpp:

          Corrected the DataReaderImpl/DataWriterImpl reference hold
          by TransportImpl. This fixed the memory leak of datawriter.

          These changes supported the default transport id.
          The range 0xFFFFFF00 to 0xFFFFFFFF is reserved for
          DEFAULT_<transport>_CONFIG values. Each specific transport
          has its default id in that range. The default transports can not
          be configured by the users. [See RT 8497]

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportDefs.h:

          Added definition for DEFAULT_SIMPLE_TCP_ID and
          DEFAULT_SIMPLE_UDP_ID.

          Increased the size of the section array in load() so it has
          enough space for a big transport id.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportFactory.cpp:

          Made the load_transport_configuration() check configuration load
          return value.

                Worked around with the compilation problems on DDS gcc 4.x build with
                DOC version TAO. The problem is the ACE_EXPORT_SINGLETON_DECLARE
                new definition was added to config-g++-common.h in DOC version
                which causes the template instantiation inside namespace errors.
                To work around this problem the TAO_DDSDCPS_SINGLETON_DECLARE
                is commented for gcc 4.x builds.

        * configure.ac:

          Added files that are needed to generate automake makefiles. The following
          command must be used to generate them from MPC:

            $MPC_ROOT/mwc.pl -include $ACE_ROOT/bin/MakeProjectCreator/config
             -type automake DDS.mwc

          You must not run mwc.pl from $ACE_ROOT/bin to do this.
          The ACE_ROOT, TAO_ROOT and DDS_ROOT environment variables must be set.
          Additionally, ACE_BUILDDIR should be set to $ACE_ROOT and TAO_BUILDDIR
          should be set to $TAO_ROOT.

          Please note that this is experimental and has not been fully tested.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/RepoIdSetMap.cpp:

          Made demarshal not return error if the repo id is already in the
          map since the subscriber could send the ack for the same repo id
          multiple times.

Mon Jul 17 05:52:33 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.cpp:

          Fixed a bug that the length of data message block is not
          written to the sample header. This would cause the publisher
          side not deliver the graceful disconnect messages even though
          it received the message from subscriber.

        * tests/transport/simple_bp/PubDriver.cpp:

        These changes support thread-per-connection send feature. The
        new configuration "thread_per_connection" is added to determine if
        the transport needs create a new thread for a datalink/connection
        to send samples under normal traffic (no backpressure). If
        thread_per_connection is 1, the publisher always creates a seperate
        send thread for each datalink/connection to do the send instead of
        sending to each remote one by one by the same thread.

        * dds/DdsDcps.mpc:

          Added new classes to support thread-per-connection send feature.

          Added thread_per_connection configuration.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.h:

          Added DataLink as friend of TransportImpl so DataLink can
          access the private data member configuration object of
          TransportImpl.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:

          Updated to use the new interfaces of the SimpleReconnectTask

        These changes fixed the test using simpleUDP. The commit
        "Thu Jun 22 16:06:21 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>" appears
        broke the UDP tests during the full association period.

          pending associations are received so the simpleUDP can simply
          always return acked.

        * TAO/DDS/DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/subscriber.cpp:

          Added more sleep period before releasing transport factory. This
          would avoid the error on publisher during shutdown.

          "Fri Jun  9 07:37:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>"
          These changes broke the Linux build.

Thu Jun 22 16:06:21 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        These changes mainly fix the problem
         "create_datawriter() does not wait for full association establishment
         so even if there are waiting subscribers,  a write shortly after
         creating the datawriter may be dropped on the publisher side because
         add_associations() has not completed on the publisher side.
         The sample may also be dropped on the subscriber side because the
         connection exists between the publisher and subscriber but the
         associations have not been mapped on the subscriber side."

         The solution is to make the subscriber send a FULLY_ASSOCIATED ack
         when the new association is received from repo and the connection is
         established. On the publisher side, the transport will notify the
         datawriter that the subscriber is fully associated when the ack is
         received. The application can use get_matched_subscriptions() to
         determine when it should start sending samples.

          Renamed the TransportGDControlElement.* to TransportControlElement.*
          so it can be used for both GRACEFUL_DISCONNECT and FULLY_ASSOCIATED
          messages.

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.h:

          Seperated remote reader handler caching and the listener
          on_publication_matched callback from add_associations(). The new
          method fully_associated() does that part which is called when the
          transport received the FYULLY_ASSOCIATED message from subscriber.

        * dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.cpp:

          Made the publisher not delete the associations after add_publication()
          is done. The associations will be deleted when transport calls the
          full_associated().

        * dds/DCPS/DataSampleHeader.h:

          Added new message id FULLY_ASSOCIATED.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportDefs.h:

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.h:

          Added local map to cache the pending association ids,pending
          association data and acked associations.

          Notify the datawriter fully association at an approriated time
          which depend on the timing when pending association is added,
          when ack is received and when the datawriter is registered with
          the TransportImpl. At either time, the pending and ack map will
          be checked to see if any assoications related to a pub id is
          fully associated.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportInterface.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportInterface.h:

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:

          Added shutdown_ flag to stop the reconnecting during shutdown.
          The shutdown reconnect task call is removed from the connection
          destructor, the shutdown will be called when the connection related
          association is removed or when the transport shutdown. This would
          avoid the destruction order problem of the connection and
          reconnect task objects.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.cpp:

        * TAO/DDS/dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy.h:

          Fixed a deadlock situation on linux when the direct_send()
          detects a lost connection and calls the relink(). The problem is the
          direct_send() is called under the lock in send strategy and the
          suspend_send() called by relink() aquires the same lock.
          To fix it, an extra parameter do_suspend is added to relink()
          function to indicate if the relink() needs call suspend_send() on
          send strategy object. If the thread calling relink() already hold
          the lock it will call the operations in suspend_send() before calling
          relink (), otherwise the relink() will call suspend_send().

        * TAO/DDS/dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.cpp:

          Added shutdown () method to SimpleTcpConnection to shutdown the
          reconnect task. This is called during transport pre-shutdown phase
          after the datalink sends graceful disconnect message. This would
          avoid an access violation during transport shutdown.

        * TAO/DDS/dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.cpp:

          Made the shutdown () do shutdown work just once if it's called multiple
          times.

        * TAO/DDS/dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Corrected a debug message.

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Added VC6 build support and a potential deadlock fix.

Fri May 12 00:00:27 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.h:

          Renamed the second version of servant_to_reference() to
          servant_to_reference_2 to resolve the compilation errors
          on VC6. The VC6 can not recognize the template function
          with same name but difference template parameters.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/publisher.cpp:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/subscriber.cpp:

          Updated to use servant_to_reference_2().

        * tests/DCPS/MultiDPTest/README:

          Made a corresponding readme.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.h:

          Added the thr_id_ data for checking if the shutdown()
          is called by the thread the task created. The thread
          should not wait for itself. This should fix a potential
          deadlock.

Mon May  8 20:16:50 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

          DDS 0.8 released.

        * VERSION:

          Updated timestamp of the 0.8 release.

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Updated one limitation note.

        * TAO_DDS_Configuration_Settings.html:

          Added reconnection configuration values.

Fri May  5 21:33:33 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Qos_Helper.h:
        * dds/DCPS/Qos_Helper.inl:

          Moved the qos operator functions from TAO::DCPS namespace to global
          namespace. This would resolve the compilation errors on DDS builds
          against DOC's latest version that the VC71 compiler can not find
          the octet sequence operator==.

        * tests/DCPS/BuiltInTopic/main.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/FooTest3_0/PubDriver.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/FooTest4/main.cpp:

          Made the qos operator== called implicitly instead of explicitly.
          Calling operator== explicitly was used as a workarround of the
          compilation problem metioned above.

        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/run_test.pl:

          Added expected lost_subscription_callback=1 to the bp_timeout test.
          This fixed the test failure on windows.

          Added inheritance from portableserver base project.
          This would resolve compilation errors shown on static builds on linux
          platforms.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/run_test-2p3s.pl:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/run_test-4p1s.pl:

          Made the repo use the repo.conf to avoid multiple requests
          handled by single orb thread at the same time. This would
          fix the problem on sunos59 gcc3.3.2 builds that the DCPSInfo
          could not be terminated. It seems without using the service
          config file, the DCPSInfo deadlocked and the TerminateWaitKill()
          in perl script will return non-zero which causes the test failure.

Fri May  5 14:44:39 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Updated notes for re-establishment of lost connection.

Thu May  4 20:06:22 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSet_rch.h

          Reversed the changes Scott made on
          "Thu Dec 15  8:35:17 USMST 2005 2005  Scott Harris  <harris_s@ociweb.com>"
          since the TAO1.4a latest version works without the change.

Wed May  3 11:30:09 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * performance-tests/DCPS/SimpleLatency/PubListener.cpp:

          Changed from char* to const char* to avoid build warnings from
          SunCC.

        * tests/DCPS/MultiDPTest/common.h:

          Removed the trailing comma from an enum to avoid build warnings
          from SunCC.

Tue May  2 16:59:07 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Qos_Helper.inl:

          Changed to call operator==(TAO::unbounded_value_sequence<CORBA::Octet>)
          explicitly. It is ugly but it resolves the compilation error on VC71
          against DOC's latest version. This seems be a compiler problem that
          does not recognize the global operator== when the global operator== is
          defined as inline and it's called by the code inside of a namespace.

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:
        * dds/DCPS/SubscriberImpl.cpp:

          Fix bugs on subscriber that does not increase the sequence length
          before adding new elements to the sequence. This problem was detected
          in FooTest4_0 with the DOC's latest version which has the new sequence
          implementation.

        * tests/transport/dds_comparative/dds_transport_comparative.mpc:

          Added inheritance from portableserver base project for subscriber.
          This would resolve compilation errors shown on static builds on linux
          platforms.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:

          Replaced the close() in SimpleTcpReconnectTask with shutdown ()
          method. The difference is the shutdown() will wait for thread
          exit. This would resolve an access violation due to the race
          condition in the SimpleTcpReconnectTask object
          Some un-necessary variables num_threads_ and active_workers_
          are also removed.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.cpp:

          Made the Datalink not send the GRACEFUL_DISCONNECT message if
          it already received the GRACEFUL_DISCONNECT message from peer.
          This would fix the error
          "SimpleTcpSendStrategy::send_bytes: ERROR: sendv: Bad file
           descriptor iovec count: 3" upon shutdown.

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Fixed a warning with unused variable.

Fri Apr 28 12:59:58 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        These changes fixes a problem on linux that transport does not
        identify peer disconnecting due to crash. This should fix
        the "run_test.pl restart_pub" test on linux.

        * dds/DdsDcps.mpc:

          Added TransportGDControlElement.cpp.

        * dds/DCPS/DataSampleHeader.h:

          Added GRACEFUL_DISCONNECT message id.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.h:

          Added new hooks so the concrete datalink can send graceful
          disconnect message before transport shutdown or releasing
          datalink.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportGDControlElement.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportGDControlElement.h:

          New type control message that does not need data_delivered
          callback.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportReceiveStrategy.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportReceiveStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.cpp:

          Made the transport also try to reconnect if it did not receive
          the graceful disconnect message when receive_bytes() returns 0.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:

          This is the correct version that Scott committed for fixing
          rae\rt8448\test failure.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:

          Fix a problem were a second disconnect and reconenct did
          not call on_*_disconnected() or on_*_reconnected().
          Yan made the initial fix and I changed it a bit.

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Correct a typo in a log message.

Sun Apr 23 22:50:40 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        These changes are made to an effort to fix rae\rt8448\test failure.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleUDP/SimpleUdpSendStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleUDP/SimpleUdpSendStrategy.inl:

          Fixed memory leaks and added more debugging messages.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.inl:

          Fixed multiple reconnected notification problem. The problem
          is the passive connection side seems not realize the lost
          connection before a new connection is reestablished.
          Changed to use the enum reconnect_state_ instead of a bool
          variable to mark various states during reconnecting and also
          seperate the active_reconnect_on_new_association() from
          active_reconnect_i() to make these function more obvious.

Sat Apr 22 21:54:02 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.inl:

          Made the elems_ and queue_ to be allocated on heap. This would help
          resolve a deadlock situation after reconnect fails. The deadlock
          happens when a send thread holds datawriter's lock and try to acquire
          the SendStrategy's lock and the reconnect thread calls terminate_send
          which got the SendStrategy's lock and drop all queued samples and try
          to call data_dropped on DataWriter. The changes makes we can remove
          queued elements outside the SendStrategy's lock.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.cpp:

          Changed to create per connection reconnect task to do the reconnecting instead
          of using single thread to do reconnecting for all datalinks in a TransportImpl.
          Hope this fix the rae\rt8448\test failure

          Added the new on_*_disconnected and on_*_reconnected to the listener
          implementations.

Fri Apr 21 01:09:00 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        The main changes are made to add the on_*_reconnected and on_*_disconnected
        new callbacks for RT8499.

        * dds/DdsDcpsPublication.idl:
        * dds/DdsDcpsSubscription.idl:

          Added the on_*_reconnected and on_*_disconnected callbacks
          Updated the *LostStatus to just contain the instance handles
          and typedef'd the *LostStatus as *DisconnectedStatus and
          *ReconnectedStatus.

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.h:

          Made the DataReader/DataWriter not cache the *LostStatus and
          added notify_*_diconnected and notify_*_reconnected to support
          the new callbacks.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.inl:

          Updated the notify() function for DISCONNECTED, RECONNECTED and
          LOST connection notification.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.inl:

          On active connection side, made the disconnected callback called
          before reconnect, the reconnceted callback called after reconnect
          succeeded and the lost connection callback called after reconnet
          failed.
          On passive connection side, made the disconnected callback called
          before reconnectschedule the timer, the reconnceted callback called
          when new connection is created and the lost connection callback
          called after the passive_reconnect_duration_ period if not reconnected.
          Updated some methods to correct the reconnect logic on the passive side.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.cpp:

          Changed to use the "old" connection object to transfer its state to
          the "new" connection object instance of using "new" connection object
          copy state from "old" connection object. This was changed since we
          need synchronize the handle_timeout() and transfer state to "new"
          connection object on the "old" connection object.

        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/DataWriterListener.h:

          Added the new callback implementations.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/run_test-2p3s.pl:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/run_test-4p1s.pl:

          Increased amount of time for the DCPSInfoRepo to shutdown.

Thu Apr 20 13:40:46 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.h:

          Updated the data_dropped() method signature to be same as in the base
          class TransportSendListener. This would fix the errors
          "ERROR: Subclass should override if sending control samples. "
          when the transport drops the control messages due to a lost
          connection.

Wed Apr 19 19:13:01 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * bin/dcps_tests.lst:

          Added tests/DCPS/Reconnect tests.

        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/DataReaderListener.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/DataWriterListener.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/publisher.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/subscriber.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/Writer.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/run_test.pl:

          Added more options to publisher and subscriber to help automate the
          reconnect tests. Changed run_test.pl to redirect the output to a log
          file so that errors due to an abnormal shutdown and lost connection
          will not show on scoreboard. The final output "test PASSED" or
          "test FAILED" will show the test result.

Wed Apr 19 13:04:26 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest3_0/FooTest3_0.mpc:

          Added inheritance from portableserver base project for subscriber.
          This would resolve compilation errors shown on static builds on linux
          platforms.

Mon Apr 17 09:45:30 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Added release notes for main changes after 0.7 release.

Sun Apr 16 22:32:55 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/DCPSInfoRepo/DCPSDataWriterI.h:
        * tests/DCPS/DCPSInfoRepo/DCPSDataWriterI.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/DCPSInfoRepo/DCPSDataReaderI.h:
        * tests/DCPS/DCPSInfoRepo/DCPSDataReaderI.cpp:

          Added the notify_lost bool parameter to the remove_association()
          method which overrides the virtual methods in
          TAO::DCPS::DataReaderImpl/DataWriterImpl. This should fix the
          test failure on remove_association.

Sun Apr 16 21:43:11 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendListener.cpp:

          Fixed a compilation warning due to an unused variable.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSynchResource.cpp:

          Fixed a bug on wait_to_unclog that passes an ACE_Time_Value::zero
          to handle_write_ready instance of 0 as the timeout parameter.
          This would fix the TCPListener performance test.

Sun Apr 16 21:53:02 2006  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/DataReaderListener.cpp:

        * tests/DCPS/Serializer/SerializerTest.cpp:
        * tests/transport/simple_n/SimpleDataWriter.cpp:
        * tests/transport/udp_simple/SimpleDataWriter.cpp:

          More scoreboard directed cleanup.

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest4/main.cpp:

          This change from std::string to ACE_CString was not dictated by
          the nightly scoreboard, but my local PC failed to compile the
          test as provided with std::string. This is on my home x86-32
          running Linux 2.6.10-1.770_FC2 with gcc version 3.3.3 20040412
          (Red Hat Linux 3.3.3-7). I felt it was not a big deal to add the
          ACE_CString since the test code is already linking in ACE to do
          parameter parsing.

Sun Apr 16 07:30:45 2006  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.h:

          Removed extraneous comma from enumeration list. I noticed that
          the enumeration also contains "NOTIFY_IMMEADIATELY" which should
          be changed to "NOTIFY_IMMEDIATELY". I'm not going to change that
          because I don't know the implications of such a change.

Sat Apr 15 13:23:09 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        These changes are tested on linux and fixed the deadlock situation
        during reconnecting.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.h:

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy.cpp:

          Made the send strategy will not wait for the reconnecting finish
          since the thread might hold the lock in DataWriterImpl and the
          reconnect thread might need call data_dropped () on DataWriterImpl
          which will cause datalock.

Sat Apr 15 11:47:43 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

          These changes are made to expect to fix a deadlock situation during
          reconencting on linux and they also fixed unregister data sample
          errors during shutdown for RT8499.

        * dds/DCPS/WriteDataContainer.cpp:

          Updated the data_dropped() to do same thing as data delivered
          when the transport initiates the data dropping which happens when
          connection lost and reconnet fails.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.h:

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:

          Made send strategy queue the connection to reconnect task in relink()
          and wait on a condition variable until the reconnect task completes
          the reconnecting and signal the condition. This would resolve the
          deadlock problem on linux and avoid using a recursive lock in
          TransportSendStrategy as a work around in my last commit.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportReceiveStrategy.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportReceiveStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.cpp:

          Made the relink() has no return value.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.cpp:

          Added DO_RECONNECT_UPON_SEND case to handle re-establishing
          of a lost connection detected by send strategy.

Thu Apr 13 17:01:08 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.h:

          Changed to use ACE_Recursive_Thread_Mutex to fix the deadlock
          situation during reconnecting on linux. This is a temporary
          workarround. I need find a better way to fix it.

Thu Apr 13 14:59:07 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

       * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/repo.conf:

          Added missing file.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:

          Fixed compilation errors on lunix build.

Thu Apr 13 12:54:39 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        These are review fix for RT8499 and the compilation errors due to
        data_dropped () and remove_sample() signature changes are also fixed.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.inl:

          Changed to use while loop instead of for loop for code clarity.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.cpp:

          Added checking of the return value from dynamic_cast.

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPS_IR_Domain.h:
        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPS_IR_Publication.h:

          Added comments for the new parameter notify_lost.

          Fixed compilation errors due to the data_dropped ()
          and remove_sample() signature changes.

Thu Apr 13 10:30:47 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        These changs are made to drop messages after the reconnect
        failed for RT8499.

        * dds/DdsDcps.mpc:

          Added RemoveAllVisitor.cpp.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/RemoveAllVisitor.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/RemoveAllVisitor.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/RemoveAllVisitor.cpp:

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendListener.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendListener.h:

          Added an extra parameter dropped_by_transport bool to the
          data_dropped(), remove_sample() and related methods. The
          dropped_by_transport true indicates the data dropping is initiated
          by transport which occurs when the transport send strategy is in
          a MODE_TERMINATED state. All messages are dropped in that state.
          The dropped_by_transport false which is the case before adding
          this extra parameter. The dropping is a result of remove_sample()
          call which is initiated by datawriter with KEEP_LAST history policy
          when the number of samples exceeds the depth of history queue.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.inl:

          Added a few SendMode types(MODE_TERMINATED, MODE_SUSPEND and
          MODE_NOT_SET). These modes are used when reconnecting logic is
          used. When the connection is lost, the mode is set to
          MODE_SUSPEND until reconnect finishes. In the MODE_SUSPEND state,
          all messages are queued. If the reconnect succeeds, the mode is
          back to the state before suspend. If the reconnect fails after
          a "conn_retry_attempts" attempts, then the mode is set to
          MODE_TERMINATED and all messages in the backpressure queue and
          packet queue are removed and the data_dropped () is called for
          every element. During the state of MODE_TERMINATED, any sending
          or queuing are stopped and the messages are dropped.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.inl:

          Added send_strategy_ data member for state change when reconnecting
          happens. The suspend_send is called before reconnecting. The
          resume_send is called when the reconnect succeeds. The terminate_send
          is called after the reconnect fails.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy_rch.h:

          Removed lost_link() hook. Now we can use the mode in the
          TransportSendStrategy to know the state of the connection.

        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/run_test.pl:

          Fixed the restart_sub test since now we drop the messages
          after reconnect failed.

        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/sub.ini:

          Change to default "conn_retry_attempts".

Tue Apr 11 11:44:32 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSynchResource.h:

          Fixed a compilation error on linux builds that need ace/Time_Value.h
          include.

Tue Apr 11 10:34:34 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy.cpp:

          Corrected lost_link() check in send_bytes().

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportDefs.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConfiguration.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConfiguration.h:

          Changed the conn_retry_backoff_multiplier_ to be double instead of float
          to avoid warnings.

Tue Apr 11 10:10:41 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        These changes are made for RT8499 to resolve the problem that publisher
        does not stop sending during reconnecting. There are two parts of the changes
        need be made and note the second part is not done yet.
          1)transport should queue the messages while reconnecting
          2)transport should discard the messages if the reconnect fails.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportReceiveStrategy.cpp:

          Made handle_input () return -1 if the receive_bytes() return -1. This would
          close the connection anyway even it will try to reconnect.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy.inl:

          Added ready_send() virtual function to check if the connection is connected.
          This will be called whenever this->synch_->work_available is called or before
          sendv. This would stop the writing on a disconnected socket.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.inl:

          Made it has reference to the SimpleTcpTransport object and
          added get_transport_impl() accessor.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.inl:

          Made relink() to queue the connection object to the SimpleTcpReconnectTask
          to do the reconnect since we don't want the reactor thread block on reconnecting
          and not receiving other incoming messages.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.h:

          Made this task handle both reconnecting and new connection checking.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.inl:

          Added reconnect task accessor so the SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy can access
          it and handle the connection to the reconnect task to do reconnect.


        These changes are made for RT8499 to add the support to declare connection
        lost upon backpressure timed out.

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Updated comments for "max_output_pause_period" configuration.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportDefs.h:

          Added GET_CONFIG_FLOAT_VALUE macro.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/PerConnectionSynch.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ThreadSynch.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ThreadSynch.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ThreadSynchResource.h:

          Made the wait_on_clogged_resource() and wait_on_unclog() return status.
          The PerConnectionSynch thread terminates if it returns an error.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConfiguration.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConfiguration.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConfiguration.inl:

          Added max_output_pause_period_ and changed the
          conn_retry_backoff_multiplier_ to be float instead of int.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.inl:

          Added new method notify_lost_on_backpressure_timeout() to support
          the disconnecting and notification when the transport stay in
          backpressure too long ( > max_output_pause_period).
          Removed unused parameter "notify" from reconnect_i().
          Accomodated with the changes of conn_retry_backoff_multiplier_
          type change.

          Added bp_timeout test case.

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest4/main.cpp:

          Made subscriber attach to transport to avoid the errors return
          from create_datareader() due to no transport.

Mon Apr 10 13:03:40 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/SubscriberImpl.cpp:

          Removed the "#if 0" in create_*/delete_* that was used to avoid
          some test failure, but the tests are fixed, we just remove it.

Fri Apr  7 00:46:47 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        These files are changed to support the connection reestablishment
        and lost connection notify. See RT8499.

        * dds/DdsDcps.mpc:

          Added new file SimpleTcpReconnectTask.h/.cpp.

        * dds/DdsDcpsDataReaderRemote.idl:
        * dds/DdsDcpsDataWriterRemote.idl:

          Added a paramter "notify_lost" to the remove_association
          in DataReaderRemote and DataWriterRemote interfaces.
          The flag true indicates the remove_association is invoked
          by the InfoRepo after it detected a lost writer/reader. The
          InfoRepo detect the lost writer/reader when the
          add_association/remove_association invocations on the writer/reader
          object reference fail. The datareader/datawriter needs notify the
          the DataReaderListener/DatawriterListener the publication/subscription
          lost.

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.h:

          Added methods to support the notification of the publication/subscription
          lost and updated the remove_associations() signature change.

        * dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/SubscriberImpl.cpp:

          Made the datareader/datawriter register with the TransportImpl upon
          creation and unregister upon deletion.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.h:

          Added notify_lost() method that is called by the SimpleTcpConnection
          upon reconnect failure. Changed the receive_strategy_ to be protected
          data so the SimpleTcpDataLink can access it.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSetMap.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSetMap.h:

          Added lock to protect the map. This would fix the problem when
          multiple add_association() are called at the same time. The
          find_or_create_set() failure causes the add_association() failure.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ReceiveListenerSetMap.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ReceiveListenerSetMap.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/RepoIdSetMap.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/RepoIdSetMap.inl:

          Added internal map accessor so we can iterate the map to notify
          listener about the lost subscriptions/publication.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.h:

          Added methods to register/unregister/find the datareader
          and datawriter object.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportInterface.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportInterface.inl:

          Added TransportImpl object reference accessor.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportReceiveStrategy.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportReceiveStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportReceiveStrategy.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.inl:

          Added relink() funcation and call it when the send_packet()
          and receive_packet() return an error.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConfiguration.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConfiguration.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConfiguration.inl:

          Added new configurations to support connection re-establishment.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.inl:

          This is the main change made for the re-establish a connection.
          Added more states to have enough information for re-establish
          and reuse the connection object. If connector/acceptor role of
          the connection is not changed when the connection is re-established.
          As the connector side, we reuse the same connection object after
          reconnected. As the acceptor side, since the ACE_Acceptor creates
          a new connection each time when it accept a connection, we can not
          reuse the connection object. The states in the "old" connection
          object are copied to the "new" connection object.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.inl:

          Added reconnect() function to replace an "old" connection with the
          "new" connection.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.inl:

          Added method to restart the ReceiveStrategy.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.h:

          This is a new class that is dedicated to check if the incoming
          connections are re-established connection from the remote. This
          would resolve the deadlock problem between the reactor thread
          (calling SimpleTcpTransport::passive_connction()) and the orb
          thread (calling SimpleTcpTransport::make_passive_connction()).
          The reactor thread will enqueue the new connection  to this task
          and let this task dequeue and check the connection.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.inl:

          Called SimpleTcpReconnectTask open and close upon transport
          initialization and shutdown.

          Fixed compilation after the "using namespace" removal change.

Mon Mar 27 16:14:47 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        These changes are made to fix the DDS test failures between machines
        with different endianess. The swap_bytes configuration value per
        TransportImpl instance is also appropriately used to allow different
        transports use different setting of swap_bytes. (See RT8381)

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:

          Made the Serializer in *DataWriterImpl::marshal() constructed
          with the swap_bytes flag based on swap_byte configuration value
          and made the Serializer in *DataReaderImpl::demarshal() constructed
          with the swap_bytes flag based on the endianess of the host and
          the byte order flag from the publisher.

        * dds/DCPS/DataSampleHeader.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataSampleHeader.inl:

          Set the swap_bytes flag to the Serializer in the reading side based
          on the the endianess of the host and the byte order flag in the data
          sample from publisher.

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Made the sample and control message header correctly set byte_order.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportHeader.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportHeader.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportHeader.inl:

          Added one more octet to the TransportHeader to indicate the endianess
          of the publisher side and updated the marshal and demarshal methods
          with the new flag.

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.h:

          Fixed the compilation error on some platforms in servant_to_reference()
          that misses the "typename" keyword for the_obj variable.

          Reduce the template parameters from 3 to 1 for servant_to_reference.
          Thanks to Don Busch for suggesting this.

        * DDS_info.txt:

          More notes from Don's questions.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.inl:

          Moved the TransportReplaceElement cached allocator from PacketRemoveVisitor
          to TransportSendStrategy to fix a bug in the transport. The problem is
          PacketRemoveVisitor is allocated on stack so the allocator is destroyed
          as the PacketRemoveVisitor goes out of scope, but late the
          TransportReplaceElement accesses the allocator and causes the access
          voilation.

          Change the hash map using void* as the key to fix the build problem
          on 64bits build.

Tue Mar 14 12:37:29 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Registered_Data_Types.cpp:

          Changed the register_type() to use the_interface_repository_id
          comparison instead of  POA_TAO::DCPS::TypeSupport_ptr comparison.
          This would allow different TypeSupport instances of the same TypeSupport
          type register with the same type name in the same domain pariticipant.
          The second (and subsequent) registrations are ignored.

        * tests/DCPS/MultiDPTest/subscriber.cpp:

          Added a test case that registers different TypeSupport instances of
          the same TypeSupport type using the same type name in a domain
          participant.

Mon Mar 13 14:50:00 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/MultiDPTest/subscriber.cpp:

          Added a type to the declaration of 'i'.

Tue Jan 24 13:54:33 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        These changes fixes a bug in Registered_Data_Types that causes
        multiple domain participants within the same domain in a process
        can not register same data types. See RT8440.

        * dds/DCPS/Registered_Data_Types.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/Registered_Data_Types.h:

          Made the DomainHash hash map use DomainParticipant object reference
          as the key instead of domain id. This would allow the data type
          be unique within a DomainParticipant and not within a domain.

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:
        * dds/DCPS/DomainParticipantImpl.cpp:

          Updated the first argument to the
          Registered_Data_Types::register_type() call.

          can register the same data type.

        * tests/DCPS/unit/MyTypeSupportImpl.cpp:

          Change config parameter from "queue_links_per_pool" to
          "queue_messages_per_pool".
          Changed transport config ""DCPSBitTransportPort" default from
          2841 to 0 so the OS will pick a port and multiple Built-in Topic
          subscribers can run on one machine.
          Fixed a bug where the config parameter "swap_bytes" was being

        The main changes are adding DDS file configuration feature. The SimpleTcp
        is still a part of DDSDcps library and other concrete transport libraries
        such as SimpleUdp can be dynamically or statically loaded.
        See the projects\DDS\design\configuration_design.txt (from CVS) for
        various scenarios of using dds configurations:

        * dds/DCPS/DataSampleList.h:

          Force the creation of a DataSampleListElement to give
          the allocator.

        * tests/DCPS/unit/Main.cpp:
        * tests/transport/dds_comparative/PubWriter.cpp:
        * tests/transport/dds_comparative/PubWriter.h:
        * tests/transport/simple_bp_rm/SimpleDataWriter.cpp:

          Added missing transport allocators.


Tue Dec 27 12:26:47 2005  Paul Calabrese  <calabrese_p@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.inl:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/SimpleLatency/PubListener.cpp:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/DataReaderListener.cpp:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/UDPListenerTest/DataReaderListener.cpp:

          Fix some GCC 3.4.2 warnings (ununsed vars and member
          initialization order).  Avoided commenting out random code.

Mon Dec 19 14:42:52 USMST 2005  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:

          Rolled back the changes that made on
          "Thu Dec 15 10:08:28 USMST 2005  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>"
          that intended to cleanup memory when the write/register fail.
          The changes need more investigation.

Mon Dec 19 09:43:03 MST 2005  Trevor Fields  <fields_t@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.cpp:

          Changed order of code to actually execute code that was
          after a return.

        * tests/transport/simple/SimpleDataWriter.cpp:
        * tests/transport/simple_bp/SimpleDataWriter.cpp:
        * tests/transport/simple_n/SimpleDataWriter.cpp:
        * tests/transport/udp_simple/SimpleDataWriter.cpp:
        * tests/transport/udp_simple_n/SimpleDataWriter.cpp:

          Changed tests to use an allocator.

Fri Dec 16 01:03:41 MST 2005  Trevor Fields  <fields_t@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/PacketRemoveVisitor.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/PacketRemoveVisitor.inl:

          Moved the method back to cpp and removed the ACE_INLINE
          declaration.  The method needed a define in the cpp file.

Fri Dec 16 00:50:26 MST 2005  Trevor Fields  <fields_t@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/PacketRemoveVisitor.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/PacketRemoveVisitor.inl:

          Moved the ACE_INLINE method to the inl file.  Not having it
          in the inl file results in an undefined reference when linking
          with the dll

Thu Dec 15 22:31:13 MST 2005  Trevor Fields  <fields_t@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSet_rch.h:

          Corrected capitalization of header include.

Thu Dec 15 10:08:28 USMST 2005  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSet.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSet.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSet.h:

          Corrected the number of chunks for map_entry_allocator_. It should be
          the number of datalinks. The map_ is also changed to be a pointer of
          hash map so we can appropiately delete the hash map with current
          implementation of ACE_Hash_Map_Manager_Ex and ACE_Hash_Map_With_Allocator.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.inl:

          Made number of chunks in header data block to be 1 instead of 2 since the
          duplicate() increases the ref count of data block.

        * dds/DCPS/Cached_Allocator_With_Overflow_T.h:
        * dds/DCPS/Dynamic_Cached_Allocator_With_Overflow_T.h:

          Added free_to_pool_ count to help debugging.

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Replaced ACE_CHECK with ACE_CHECK_RETURN in some methods with a return
          type.

        * dds/DCPS/WriteDataContainer.cpp:

          Made obtain_buffer() and register_instance() release memory it allocates
          if the methods return error.
          Made the number of chunks for data allocator to be the
          max_samples of resource_limits in qos if that value is not
          LENGTH_UNLIMITED.

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.cpp:

          Fixed a bug in parse_args() that causes crash when passing multiple
          -DCPS options.

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:

          Made write_w_timestamp() release marshalled data sample if write fails.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/UDPListenerTest/DataReaderListener.cpp:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/DataReaderListener.cpp:

          Uncommented the read_samples() which might be accidently checked in previously.

Thu Dec 15  8:35:17 USMST 2005 2005  Scott Harris  <harris_s@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSet_rch.h

          Get the DdsDcps project to build against TAO v 1.4.7.
          Needed to explicitly include the ACE version header so that
          conditional complication that makes DDS build with both the DOC
          and OCI versions of TAO worked.
          Strangely, this is not needed for the latest DOC TAO from CVS
          or when building with gcc/GNUmakefile but is needed for VC71.

          Replaced the TransportSendControlElement, TransportSendElement,
          TransportReplacedElement and TransportSendStrategy header message
          block allocation from heap with the cached allocator.

        * dds/DdsDcps.mpc:

          Listed the files in same directory in alphabet order.

        * dds/DCPS/Dynamic_Cached_Allocator_With_Overflow_T.h:

          Changed Allocators to log an error message when more
          memory is freed to the heap than is allocated.

          Constructor did not correctly use and save the rounded up size
           for allocating!  This resulted in invalid pointer locations
           used for small object sizes on the 64 bit OS.

        * dds/DCPS/Qos_Helper.h:
          Solaris compilers failed when the method declaration was
          extern and the definition was inline.  Added a macro

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Can not use LONG_MAX for CORBA::Long because on some
          architectures the long is 8 bytes while a CORBA::Long
          is always 4 bytes.

        * tests/DCPS/Serializer/SerializerTest.cpp:

          Fixed issue with using a long double as a
          character array all the time.

          Add a space to some templates.  Things of the form <::DDS::Ident
          won't work because <: is a C++ digraph.

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          Fix an initialization order warning

          (TCP_NODELAY).  The default is to disable Nagle's algorithm.
          This was uncovered by some latency testing.  Some
          performance tests with small sample sizes may benefit
          from enabling this algorithm.

          Increase the sample and packet lengths to be 32 bit integers
          so we can support larger samples (greater than 64 KB).

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleUDP/SimpleUdpConfiguration.inl:

          Limit the simple UDP transport to about 64 KB samples
          because of its lack of fragmentation and the MTU.

Thu Jul 28 13:17:03 USMST 2005  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:

          Fixed memory leak of DataReaderRemote object references.
          - Made the get_dr_obj_ref () assign to a DataReader_var
            since the accessor duplicates object reference count.

        * dds/DCPS/Marked_Default_Qos.cpp:

          Fixed memory leak of DomainParticipantFactory object reference.
          - Made TheParticipantFactory assign to
            DomainParticipantFactory_var since the TheParticipantFactory
            duplicates the object reference count.

        * dds/DCPS/WriteDataContainer.cpp:

          Fixed memory leak of the registered sample data and the
          PublicationInstance object.
          - Made the unregister_all() delete all PublicationInstance
            objects in the instance handle list.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/publisher.cpp:

          Fixed memory leak of the DataWriter object reference.
          - Delete every Writer object after test is done.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/subscriber.cpp:

          Fixed the memory leak of the listener servant.
          - Made the servant assign to PortableServer::ServantBase_var.

        * dds/DCPS/DataBlockLockPool.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataBlockLockPool.h:

          Created a class to give out ACE_Thread_Mutex lock adapters.
          This just cycles through an array giving out the next lock.
          It does not currently require the returning of the locks.

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:
        * bin/DCPS/HTemplate.pm:

          Changed to use a DataBlockLockPool for providing locks to the
          ACE_Data_Blocks.  The blocks need to be locked to prevent the
          simultaneous access by multiple threads from deforming the
          reference count.

          fails.  This code is marked with "//remove" and
          "DUMP_FOR_PACKET_INFO"

          This code should be removed when the problem has been fixed.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/SimpleE2ETest/Reader.cpp:

          Fixed error with data size.

Fri Jul 22 08:40:18 MST 2005  Scott Harris <harris_s@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy.cpp:

          Make SimpleTcpSendStrategy::send_bytes log the iovec array when
          sendv returns an unexpected errno in hopes of getting it to
          core when the sendv fails for AAC.  Hopefully this will shed
          some light on the problem.

          Added -sd <msec> option to allow the subscriber to sleep for
          <msec> milliseconds for every read call.
          This was added to see what would happend if there was a slow
          subscriber.

          Corrected comment about why the instance state is not
          deleted in the destructor.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:

          Added delete of queue in destructor.  It was new'd in

Mon Jul 18 17:27:29 2005  Paul Calabrese  <calabrese_p@ociweb.com>

        * tests/transport/simple_bp/SimpleSubscriber.cpp:

          Fix return value error that VC6 caught.

Mon Jul 18 13:30:13 2005  Paul Calabrese  <calabrese_p@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest5/publisher.cpp:

          Remove extra fclose() that was causing failures.

        * DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/subscriber.cpp:

          Update and merge the devguide example.  I put it here
          because it proved difficult to integrate into the TAO
          DevGuideExamples directory.

Mon Jul 18 06:43:11 MST 2005  Scott Harris <harris_s@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.h:

          Backed out the change of Thu Jul 14 12:39:15 MST 2005
          because reference_to_servant was fixed in 1.4a_p4.

Sat Jul 16 17:51:05 MST 2005  Scott Harris <harris_s@ociweb.com>

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:

          Make samples replaced in the subscriber's instance queue delete as
          well as free the sample.

        * dds/DCPS/ReceivedDataElementList.inl:

          Added a comment about the ReceivedDataElement destructor
          needing to destroy its InstanceState. But it currently
          causes troubles.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/run_test.pl:

          Change the number of samples from 80,000 to 20,000.

Fri Jul 15 16:01:19 MST 2005  Scott Harris <harris_s@ociweb.com>

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:

          Added Paul C's changes to free read elements in the subscriber
          side instance queue that are being replaced by the recieved
          samples.  It still leaks the if the sample contains a type
          that requires freeing the fields individiually (like sequences).

        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/run_test.pl:

          Changed this test to just have MAX_SAMPLES and
          MAX_SAMPLES_PER_INSTANCE set to the number that will be in
          the instance queue plus some for good measure.
          Previously it would set MAX_SAMPLES and PER_INSTANCE to
          the number of expected samples.

Thu Jul 14 12:39:15 MST 2005  Scott Harris <harris_s@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.h:

          Changed reference_to_servant template to not remove
          a reference to the servant because POA::reference_to_servant
          changed in TAO 1.4a (and 1.4.x) to not increment
          the reference count.

Wed Jun 29 11:16:05 MST 2005  Trevor Fields  <fields_t@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Definitions.h:
          Changed ACE_Message_Block allocator to use an ACE_Thread_Lock
          The message block's duplicate method was using the same
          allocator in different threads at the same time.

Tue Jun 10 18:55:09 UTC 2005  Trevor Fields  <fields_t@ociweb.com>

          Moved files from a branch off of TAO 1.4a to this separate
          repository.
          All files in ACE_wrappers/TAO/orbsvcs/DDS and
                       ACE_wrappers/TAO/orbsvcs/orbsvcs/DDS and
                       ACE_wrappers/bin/DCPS
          were moved over.
