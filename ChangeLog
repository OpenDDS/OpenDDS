Fri May 17 21:10:32 UTC 2013  Phillip LaBanca  <labancap@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/RTPS/Sedp.cpp:

          Added spdp shutdown checks to avoid race condition in task
          enqueue methods.

Tue May 14 21:18:14 UTC 2013  Paul Calabrese  <calabrese_p@ociweb.com>

        * dds/idl/metaclass_generator.cpp:

          Fix a code generation bug with typedefs of types like
          octets (char, wchar, boolean also) used in DCPS types.

        * tests/DCPS/Compiler/idl_test3_lib/FooDef.idl:

          Add a typedef-ed octet to this regression test.

        * tests/DCPS/Compiler/idl_test3_main/main.cpp:

          Manually adjust the marshaling and padding sizes for
          this test.

        * tests/DCPS/ManyTopicTest/subscriber.cpp:

          Fixed errors that only occurred on some compilers.

          Added config options to bind RTPS-related multicast sockets
          to specific network interfaces, similar to the local_address
          option in the multicast transport.  The new options are...
          In rtps_udp transport instance: multicast_interface=<string>
          In rtps_discovery: MulticastInterface=<string>

Fri May 10 15:48:28 UTC 2013  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * dds/idl/HTemplate.txt:

          Added nested typedefs to the generated FooTypeSupportImpl class
          in order to facilitate template programming using these types.

        * tests/DCPS/ManyTopicTest/DataReaderListener.h:

        * tests/DCPS/ManyTopicTest/subscriber.cpp:

          Demonstrate the use of templates with the typedefs mentioned above.
          This removes quite a bit of duplicated and almost-duplicated code
          from the test which uses 4 topics and 3 topic types.

        * tools/modeling/codegen/model/Sync.h:
        * tools/modeling/codegen/model/Sync.cpp:

Thu Apr 25 08:29:16 UTC 2013  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:
          Decouple the DataReader from the ContentFilteredTopic as
          part of the delete_datareader call instead of doing it
          in the destructor.

Mon Apr 22 18:41:38 UTC 2013  Byron Harris  <harrisb@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/SubscriberCycle/SubscriberCycle.mpc:

          Added base project that was overlooked as part of
          commit to disable building when CFT is built.

Fri Apr 19 19:19:48 UTC 2013  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * DDS_TAOv2.mwc:

          Include a directory instead of an mpc file for IORTable.
          Allows more flexibility for changes in different TAO versions.

Fri Apr 19 17:30:19 UTC 2013  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

Thu Apr 18 17:47:40 UTC 2013  Byron Harris  <harrisb@ociweb.com>

        * bin/dcps_tests.lst:

          Don't run SubscriberCycle test for DDS build
          with content filtered topics disabled.

        * tests/DCPS/SubscriberCycle/SubscriberCycle.mpc:

          Don't build SubscriberCycle test for DDS build
          with content filtered topics disabled. Complete
          fix from previous commit so builds using an
          install of OpenDDS.

        * tests/DCPS/SubscriberCycle/Subscriber.cpp:

          Fixed warning about signed/unsigned comparison.

Mon Apr 15 15:47:37 UTC 2013  Byron Harris  <harrisb@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/SubscriberCycle/SubscriberCycle.mpc:

Mon Apr 15 12:57:37 UTC 2013  Byron Harris  <harrisb@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/SubscriberCycle/Subscriber.cpp:

          Added #include to explicity pick up definition of
          DDS::ContentFilteredTopic_ptr.

Fri Apr 12 14:14:23 UTC 2013  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * DDS_TAOv2.mwc:

          Added DynamicInterface to the list of TAO libraries used.
          The DOC Group version now requires it for IORTable.

Thu Apr 11 14:31:09 UTC 2013  Byron Harris  <harrisb@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/SubscriberCycle/SubscriberListenerImpl.cpp:

          Fixed Visual C++ compile error.

Wed Apr 10 20:19:29 UTC 2013  Byron Harris  <harrisb@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          During cleanup cancel any deadline watchdog timers associated
          with the reader. This fixes a problem when the reader's subscriber
          is deleted in one thread while deadline timeout handling in the
          watchdog thread tries to access the deleted subscriber.

          A test that creates/deletes a subscriber multiple times while
          a publisher is contining to publish samples. This test was
          used to activate the deadline handling code trying to access
          a deleted subscriber and verify the fix. The test has a
          number of command line options described in the README that
          can be used to help identify if there are other issues with
          subscriber deletion in the presence of sample processing.

Wed Mar 27 20:05:13 UTC 2013  Byron Harris  <harrisb@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/FileSystemStorage.h:

          Reverting previous change after discovering GNU C++
          incorrectly allowed template based Directory::Iterator
          to access File's private constructor.

Wed Mar 27 19:44:12 UTC 2013  Byron Harris  <harrisb@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/FileSystemStorage.h:

          Removed unnecessary class friendship.

        * tests/DCPS/ManyTopicMultiProcess/Foo4Def.idl:

          Refactored to use a TAO built-in type per the OpenDDS faq.

        * tests/DCPS/ManyTopicTypes/ManyTopicTypes.mpc:

          Removed Foo4Def previously added for the ManyTopicMultiProcess test

        * tests/DCPS/ManyTopicTypes/Foo4Def.idl:

          Removed this file.

Wed Mar 13 20:45:37 UTC 2013  Phillip LaBanca  <labancap@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/ManyTopicMultiProcess/DataReaderListener4.cpp:

          Made include path to MultiTopicType relative and fixed
          missing OS_NS_time include statements.

        * tests/DCPS/ManyTopicMultiProcess/run_test.pl:

          Added a missing unlink statement for the repo ior file.

Tue Mar 12 21:31:08 UTC 2013  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          If a single message is both dispose & unregister,
          the message block needs to be duplicated so that each
          operation can read the key fields.

        * dds/DCPS/RTPS/Spdp.h:
        * dds/DCPS/RTPS/Spdp.cpp:

          Use a separate buffer for writing instead of sharing the
          one used for reading.  The initial implementation never
          overlapped reads and writes, but now receiving data from
          a new remote participant causes our announcement to be
          sent immediately.

        * dds/DCPS/RTPS/Sedp.cpp:

          Interoperability fix for discovery with Content-Filtered
          Topics: certain fields must be non-empty strings even
          though they are not needed.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/rtps_udp/RtpsUdpDataLink.cpp:

          Fixed two corner cases for DURABILITY QoS:
          - Removed the work-around from Wed Dec 19 16:34:05 UTC 2012,
            it is not needed due to Thu Jan 10 16:06:08 UTC 2013 and removing
            the work-around improves interoperability.
          - If the nacked range is entirely below the durable data range,
            a Gap submessage is needed so that the reader can proceed to the
            higher sequence numbers.

        * examples/DCPS/ishapes/ShapesDialog.cpp:
        * examples/DCPS/ishapes/main.cpp:
