        * tools/scripts/lcov.pl:

          Fixing script for nightly build.

        * tests/DCPS/BuiltInTopicTest/publisher.cpp:

          Corrected #includes needed for static builds.  These were not picked
          up by the script that changed all of the others last week.

        * tests/DCPS/Monitor/Messenger.mpc:

          Fixed broken references to the monitoring library, caused by
          this mpc file directly listing the project in 'libs' and 'after'
          instead of using the provided mpb file.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ReceiveListenerSet.inl:

          The method for re-setting rd_ptr() when there are multiple
          listeners needs to account for the fact that continuation
          blocks also have their rd_ptr()s modified during demarshaling.
