          Undo changes from commit "Wed Aug 27 14:18:17 UTC 2014"
          as this resulted in checking if an unsigned value is less
          than 0, which is always false.

          Avoid null dereference check after Coverity reported such a
          dereference was possible.

          Remove ZeroCopySeq::decrement_reference() which was only
          being called by code that implemented DataReaderImpl::take_generic().
          This function had questionable semantics anyway since it
          wasn't clear what the expected behavior was if the reference
          count went to zero.
