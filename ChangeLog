        * DDS_TAOv2.mwc:

          Added DynamicInterface to the list of TAO libraries used.
          The DOC Group version now requires it for IORTable.

        * tests/DCPS/SubscriberCycle/SubscriberListenerImpl.cpp:

          Fixed Visual C++ compile error.

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          During cleanup cancel any deadline watchdog timers associated
          with the reader. This fixes a problem when the reader's subscriber
          is deleted in one thread while deadline timeout handling in the
          watchdog thread tries to access the deleted subscriber.

          A test that creates/deletes a subscriber multiple times while
          a publisher is contining to publish samples. This test was
          used to activate the deadline handling code trying to access
          a deleted subscriber and verify the fix. The test has a
          number of command line options described in the README that
          can be used to help identify if there are other issues with
          subscriber deletion in the presence of sample processing.

        * dds/DCPS/FileSystemStorage.h:

          Reverting previous change after discovering GNU C++
          incorrectly allowed template based Directory::Iterator
          to access File's private constructor.

Wed Mar 27 19:44:12 UTC 2013  Byron Harris  <harrisb@ociweb.com>

Tue Mar 12 21:31:08 UTC 2013  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          If a single message is both dispose & unregister,
          the message block needs to be duplicated so that each
          operation can read the key fields.

        * dds/DCPS/RTPS/Spdp.h:
        * dds/DCPS/RTPS/Spdp.cpp:

          Use a separate buffer for writing instead of sharing the
          one used for reading.  The initial implementation never
          overlapped reads and writes, but now receiving data from
          a new remote participant causes our announcement to be
          sent immediately.

        * dds/DCPS/RTPS/Sedp.cpp:

          Interoperability fix for discovery with Content-Filtered
          Topics: certain fields must be non-empty strings even
          though they are not needed.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/rtps_udp/RtpsUdpDataLink.cpp:

          Fixed two corner cases for DURABILITY QoS:
          - Removed the work-around from Wed Dec 19 16:34:05 UTC 2012,
            it is not needed due to Thu Jan 10 16:06:08 UTC 2013 and removing
            the work-around improves interoperability.
          - If the nacked range is entirely below the durable data range,
            a Gap submessage is needed so that the reader can proceed to the
            higher sequence numbers.

        * examples/DCPS/ishapes/ShapesDialog.cpp:
        * examples/DCPS/ishapes/main.cpp:

          If the PARTITION QoS is non-default, add it to the
          window's title bar so it is visible in the UI.
