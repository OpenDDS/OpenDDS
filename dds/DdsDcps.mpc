// Approach to translating IDL files
// =================================
// A type defined in an IDL file belongs to one of three categories:
//   1. message type - Values of this type will be serialized and sent in messages.
//   2. interface type - Values of this type are objects described by the spec or
//      an extension.  These types are not serialized.
//   3. support type - Remaining types.  Often used in conjunction with an
//      interface.

// For each type, we must generate a language mapping which is the
// expression of the type in C++.  When using tao_idl for language
// mapping, the generated code will be placed in fileC.h, fileC.cpp, and
// fileC.inl.  When using opendds_idl with -Lface or -Lspcpp, the
// generated code will be placed in fileC.h, fileTypeSupportImpl.h, and
// fileTypeSupportImpl.cpp.

// For message types, we must generate serialization and deserialization
// code.  If tao_idl is used to generate the language mapping, then
// opendds_idl can be used to generate fileTypeSupport.idl,
// fileTypeSupportImpl.h, and fileTypeSupportImpl.cpp.  The
// fileTypeSupport.idl file is then processed with tao_idl to generate a
// language mapping for readers and writers of that type.  If opendds_idl
// is used to generate the language mapping, then the appropriate code is
// already generated in fileTypeSupportImpl.h and
// fileTypeSupportImpl.cpp.

// If type support is generated for a file, then all IDL files that it
// includes must also have type support files generated.  The compiler
// will let you know if you do this.

// So, given a particular IDL file, should tao_idl or opendds_idl be used
// to process it?

// The answer to this question depends on three things:
//  1. The content of the file.
//  2. The presence of builtin topics.
//  3. Standard profile vs. safety profile.

// If an IDL file defines (as opposed to declaring) an interface, then
// tao_idl must be used to generate its language mapping.  This is the
// only processing required for these files.  If the file contains
// message types, then they should be moved to a different file and
// included.

// For IDL files containing message types, there are three scenarios (see
// dcps_optional_safety.mpb):

//  1. Standard profile with builtin topics

//    The main driver here in the InfoRepo.  Most files will be processed
//    with tao_idl, type support will be generated with opendds_idl, and
//    then fileTypeSupport.idl will be processed with tao_idl.

// 2. Standard profile with no builtin topics

//    Similar to the previous case except fileTypeSupport.idl and its
//    products can be avoided for most files.

// 3. Safety profile (with builtinin topics)

//    The main driver here is control of the language mapping.  In this
//    configuration, opendds_idl is used with -I (prevent
//    fileTypeSupport.idl) and -Lspcpp (to generate language mappings and
//    serialization code).  Message types for builtin topics are in
//    DdsDcpsCore.idl which means that opendds_idl generates
//    DdsDcpsCoreTypeSupport.idl which is then processed with tao_idl.

// Various interfaces use sequences of interfaces.  This is a problem in
// safety profile builds because the included TAO headers have calls to
// global operator new.  Sequences of interfaces are handled by pulling
// out the sequence typedef to a separate file.  This allows the sequence
// to be processed by opendds_idl in the safety profile.  The only caveat
// is that the fileTypeSupportImpl.cpp file requires access to the
// definition of the sequence element type.  This is accomplished by
// manually (using a commandline option) adding an include to the
// fileTypeSupportImpl.cpp.
