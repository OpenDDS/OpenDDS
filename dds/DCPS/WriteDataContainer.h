/**
 * @class WriteDataContainer
 *
 * @brief A container for instances sample data.
 *
 * This container is instantiated per DataWriter. It maintains
 * list of PublicationInstance objects which is internally
 * referenced by the instance handle.
 *
 * This container contains threaded lists of all data written to a
 * given DataWriter. The real data sample is represented by the
 * DataSampleElement.  The data_holder_ holds all
 * DataSampleElement in the writing order via the
 * next_writer_sample_/previous_writer_sample_ thread. The instance list in
 * PublicationInstance links samples via the next_instance_sample_
 * thread.
 *
 * There are three state transition lists used during write operations:
 * unsent, sending, and sent.  These lists are linked
 * via the next_send_sample_/previous_send_sample_ thread. Any
 * DataSampleElement should be in one of these three lists and
 * SHOULD NOT be shared between these three lists.
 * A normal transition of a DataSampleElement would be
 * unsent->sending->sent.  A DataSampleElement transitions from unsent
 * to sent naturally during a write operation when get_unsent_data is called.
 * A DataSampleElement transitions from sending to sent when data_delivered
 * is called notifying the container that the transport is finished with the
 * sample and it can be marked as a historical sample.
 * A DataSampleElement may transition back to unsent from sending if
 * the transport notifies that the sample was dropped and should be resent.
 * A DataSampleElement is removed from sent list and freed when the instance
 * queue or container (for another instance) needs more space.
 * A DataSampleElement may be removed and freed directly from sending when
 * and unreliable writer needs space.  In this case the transport will be
 * notified that the sample should be removed.
 * A DataSampleElement may also be removed directly from unsent if an unreliable
 * writer needs space for new samples.
 * Note: The real data sample will be freed when the reference counting goes 0.
 * The resend list is only used when the datawriter uses
 * TRANSIENT_LOCAL_DURABILITY_QOS. It holds the DataSampleElements
 * for the data sample duplicates of the sending and sent list and
 * hands this list off to the transport.
 *
 *
 *
 * @note: 1) The PublicationInstance object is not removed from
 *           this container until the instance is
 *           unregistered. The same instance handle is reused for
 *           re-registration. The instance data is deleted when
 *           this container is deleted. This would simplify
 *           instance data memory management. An alternative way
 *           is to remove the handle from the instance list when
 *           unregister occurs and delete the instance data after
 *           the transport is done with the instance, but we do
 *           not have a way to know when the transport is done
 *           since we have the sending list for all instances in
 *           the same datawriter.
 *        2) This container has the ownership of the instance data
 *           samples when the data is written. The type-specific
 *           datawriter that allocates the memory for the sample
 *           data gives the ownership to its base class.
 *        3) It is the responsibility of the owner of objects of
 *           this class to ensure that access to the lists are
 *           properly locked.  This means using the same
 *           lock/condition to access the lists via the enqueue(),
 *           get*(), and data_delivered() methods.  For the case
 *           where these are all called from the same (client)
 *           thread, this should be a recursive lock so that: 1)
 *           we do not deadlock; and, 2) we incur the cost of
 *           obtaining the lock only once.
