# QoS XML Handler

Optional utility to allow one to define the QoS of DDS entities using XML.

## `dds_qos.hpp`

Note that if `dds_qos.hpp` is regenerated without any intervention, the include
guard will fail the `missing_include_guard` check of lint.pl. The include guard
will have to be modified to pass the check.
