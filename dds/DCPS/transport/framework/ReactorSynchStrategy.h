/**
 * @class ReactorSynchStrategy
 *
 * @brief strategy to construct ReactorSynch implementations of ThreadSynch.
 *
 * This class is used as a factory for ReactorSynch objects that can be
 * used to scheduled queued output for processing on a reactor.  The
 * initial implementation will share the Transport reactor for all of the
 * sending and receiving processing to be performed.  If the reactor is
 * upgraded to a thread pool reactor, then this processing can be split
 * between those threads using the default leader-follower dispatching.
 *
 * The usage idiom for ThreadSynchStrategy ensures that his object will
 * have valid raw pointer values during its lifetime.
