Minimal Messenger Example

This example is provided so users can have a simpler example than the
current Messenger.  It makes use of the Sync objects for syncronization
and moves the setup/cleanup code out of main to boilerplate namespace
for a simpler view on how to publish samples and process received samples.
Boilerplate also replaces NULL pointers with execptions to eliminate the need
for main to check return values and write out individual log messages.

To be explained in-depth in the upcoming getting started guide.
