          For details see the branch-specific change log at
          docs/history/ChangeLog-multitopic.

Mon Jul 19 14:20:37 UTC 2010  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * tools/odds_monitor/TreeNode.h:

          Changed QList<>::removeOne() to QList<>::removeAll() to allow
          use with earlier Qt 4.3 version.

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Fixed nightly build compile errors.

        * dds/DCPS/Definitions.h:

          Fixed nightly build warning. LONG_MAX and LONG_MIN
          are actually the unsigned long max and min for
          linux.

Wed Jul 14 20:56:38 UTC 2010  Brian Johnson  <johnsonb@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Definitions.h:

          Changed to use ACE_INT32.  Made SequenceNumber a class
          and provided accessors to value_.  Also made a typedef
          for ACE_INT32 to use when a SequenceNumber value is not
          being stored in a SequenceNumber.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/MulticastTypes.h:

          Removed redundant type.

        * dds/DCPS/ReceivedDataElementList.h:
        * dds/DCPS/SubscriptionInstance.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:

        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/ReliableSession.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/ReliableSession.cpp:

          Changed to pass SequenceNumber instead of internal
          value.  And changed to use SequenceNumber::Value
          and getValue().

        * dds/DCPS/DisjointSequence.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DisjointSequence.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/DisjointSequence.cpp:

          Int16 to Int32 changes and removed unused depth function.

        * tests/DCPS/UnitTests/DisjointSequence.cpp:

          Int16 to Int32 changes and removal of functions.

Wed Jul 14 18:21:35 UTC 2010  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DisjointSequence.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DisjointSequence.cpp:

          Added a dump() method to help debugging.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/MulticastConfiguration.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/MulticastConfiguration.cpp:

          Added nak_delay_intervals configuration parameter to define the
          number of intervals between naks after the initial nak.  This
          makes the initial nak sent right away and resend after delayed
          intervals. This could reduce naks.

          Added nak_max configuration parameter to limit the maximum number
          of times a missing sample will be nak'ed for.  Set this parameter
          so the nak will be not be sent repeatedly for the unrecoverable
          packets.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/ReliableSession.h:

          Changed NakRequestMap from multimap to map as the key is
          always unique.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/ReliableSession.cpp:

          Changed expire_naks() to remove looping through nak requests,
          to shift the sequence baseline instead of resetting it, and
          to make time out message clearer.

          Changed send_naks() to use new configuration parameters
          nak_delay_intervals and nak_max.  Missing samples will now be
          nak'ed for on the first nak_interval and then after every
          nak_delay_intervals until the missing sample has been nak'ed
          for nak_max times or the nak_timeout has expired.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/multicast.ini-dist:

          Added new configurations.

        * dds/idl/CPPTemplate.txt:

          Excluded disposal and unregister messages from check for
          max samples as this was causing these messages to be lost.

Tue Jul 13 14:25:56 UTC 2010  Brian Johnson  <johnson_b@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DisjointSequence.cpp:

          Fix for broken nightly build.

Mon Jul 12 20:54:17 UTC 2010  Brian Johnson  <johnsonb@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Definitions.h:

          Change operator< to double the distance and compare this with
          the range of valid positive values so that < would never be ambiguious,
          since the distance will always be even and range is odd.  Error was
          exposed by UnitTests/SequenceNumber.cpp lines 38 and 42.

        * dds/DCPS/DisjointSequence.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DisjointSequence.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/DisjointSequence.cpp:

          Added private function to determine what the previous sequence
          number should be.  Error was exposed by
          UnitTest/DisjointSequence.cpp lines 213-223.

        * tests/DCPS/UnitTests/DisjointSequence.cpp:

          Added tests to expose errors in DisjointSequence logic.

        * tests/DCPS/UnitTests/SequenceNumber.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/UnitTests/UnitTests.mpc:

          Added SequenceNumber tests.

Mon Jul 12 20:03:15 UTC 2010  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/SubscriberImpl.cpp:
        * dds/idl/CPPTemplate.txt:

          Corrected the behave when subscriber has INSTANCE or TOPIC
          presentation qos and publisher has GROUP presentation qos.

        * dds/DCPS/DomainParticipantImpl.cpp:

          Added check for nil bit_pub_dr_ in ownership_manager().
          This prevents crash when builtin topic is turned off in a non
          minimum bit build.

        * tests/DCPS/GroupPresentation/DataReaderListener.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/GroupPresentation/SubscriberListener.h:
        * tests/DCPS/GroupPresentation/SubscriberListener.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/GroupPresentation/run_test.pl:
        * tests/DCPS/GroupPresentation/subscriber.cpp:

          Added subscriber TOPIC and INSTANCE test cases.

        * bin/dcps_tests.lst:

          Added GroupPresentation new test cases.

Mon Jul 12 16:21:33 UTC 2010  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * java/idl2jni/codegen/be_global.h:
        * java/idl2jni/codegen/be_global.cpp:
        * java/idl2jni/codegen/be_util.h:
        * java/idl2jni/codegen/be_util.cpp:

          The same change is needed for idl2jni to work with the
          latest DOC group tao_idl and remain compatible with 1.5a and 1.6a.

Mon Jul 12 15:20:10 UTC 2010  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * dds/idl/be_global.h:
        * dds/idl/be_global.cpp:

          Restored compatibility with TAO 1.5a and 1.6a after Jeff's change.

Mon Jul 12 08:44:58 UTC 2010  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * dds/idl/be_util.cpp:
        * dds/idl/be_util.h:

          New files, containing a utility
          class with static methods.

        * dds/idl/be_global.cpp:
        * dds/idl/be_global.h:

          Moved methods not related to
          global data storage to new
          utility class.

Fri Jul  9 20:14:17 UTC 2010  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/OwnershipManager.cpp:

          Fixed a bug that adds same writer to ownership candidate
          list multiple times when its strength is changed to be greater
          than current owner. This was observed from subscriber log in
          ownership update_strength test.

        * tests/DCPS/Ownership/Writer.cpp:

          Add one second delay before reset the writer strength to be higher,
          so the builtin topic data update arrives only after samples with
          previous strength on subscriber side. This helps simplify result
          verification on subscriber side.

Tue Jul  6 18:20:11 UTC 2010  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/Ownership/Writer.cpp:

          Fixed crash on linux due to ACE_CString passed as string format
          logging parameter.

Tue Jul  6 14:43:41 UTC 2010  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest3_0/FooTest3_0.mpc:

          Added an "after" for correct behavior in parallel builds.

Tue Jul  6 07:25:37 UTC 2010  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          Added a map to WriterInfo to keep track whether ownership need
          be evaluated for each instance. Previously, it used single flag
          for all instances sent by the writer. This is the bug that cause
          only samples belong the first instance were received when higher
          strength writer took ownership and published multiple instances.

        * dds/DCPS/DomainParticipantImpl.cpp:

          Fixed a deadlock issue that caused by reverse locking between
          DomainParticipantImpl subscribers_protector_ and ReceiveListenerSet
          lock_. This happened when one thread deleting subscriber from
          delete_contained_entities() while the reactor thread delievered
          builtin topic data sample and called BitPubListenerImpl to update
          ownership strength.

        * dds/DCPS/OwnershipManager.h:
        * dds/DCPS/OwnershipManager.cpp:

          Passed instance handle to some methods to help debugging.

        * tests/DCPS/Ownership/DataReaderListener.h:
        * tests/DCPS/Ownership/DataReaderListener.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/Ownership/Messenger.idl:
        * tests/DCPS/Ownership/Writer.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/Ownership/run_test.pl:

          Made publisher to publish multiple instances to verify the bug
          fix.

Tue Jun 29 21:39:39 UTC 2010  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * java/FAQ:

          Fixed a few typos.

Mon Jun 28 16:07:20 UTC 2010  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/Serializer_wstring/Serializer_wstring.mpc:

          Added an "after" to allow correct operation with parallel builds.

Mon Jun 28 15:53:43 UTC 2010  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * dds/idl/be_global.cpp:

          Added argument parsing for --export=Foo (backwards-compatibility with
          dcps_ts.pl).

Mon Jun 28 15:08:30 UTC 2010  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/Ownership/Writer.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/Ownership/publisher.cpp:

          Renamed global variable "delay" to avoid conflict with QNX system
          headers.

        * tests/DCPS/UnitTests/LivelinessCompatibility.cpp:

          Need another #include for inline=0 GCC 3.3.x compatibility.

Fri Jun 25 20:47:38 UTC 2010  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/Ownership/subscriber.cpp:

          Moved result verify after Service_Participant shutdown.
          This would fix pure function called error on linux due
          to earlier result verify which failed sometimes.

Fri Jun 25 18:36:19 UTC 2010  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * bin/dcps_tests.lst:

          Marked the Ownership update_strength test only run
          when built in topic is enabled.

        * dds/DCPS/OwnershipManager.cpp:

          Fixed a memory corruption due to a possibility to
          erase vector end.

Thu Jun 24 21:21:57 UTC 2010  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/GroupRakeData.h:

          More GCC 3.3.x work-arounds.

        * dds/idl/be_produce.cpp:

          Use main_filename() instead of filename() since some pre-processors
          use a temporary filename (SunCC).

        * examples/DCPS/Messenger_IOGR_Imr/Messenger_IOGR_Imr.mpc:

          Make sure we get rules.dds.GNU included in the makefile.

        * tests/DCPS/ViewState/ViewState.mpc:
        * tests/DCPS/ZeroCopyRead/ZeroCopyRead.mpc:

          Simplified mpc files: no need to list a "Source_Files" section.

        * tests/DCPS/SharedTransport/TestCase.cpp:

          Added 2 seconds delay before writing samples for test with udp
          transport as the udp does not do fully association establishment
          between pub and sub.

        * dds/idl/opendds_idl.mpc:

          In the verbatim(gnuace), add the "all" target as a prerequisite of
          "idl_stubs" so that if the user runs "make idl_stubs", opendds_idl
          will be built first.

        * dds/DCPS/CoherentChangeControl.cpp:

          Added newline at the end of the file to avoid a GCC warning and for
          general consistency.

        * dds/idl/be_global.cpp:

          WCHAR compatibility.

        * dds/idl/opendds_idl.mpc:

Mon Jun 21 17:47:44 UTC 2010  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * Merged the branch "sbir_n08_116", which includes changes for spec
          compliance.  See docs/history/ChangeLog-sbir_n08_116 for details.
          Major features added are:

          - Content-Subscription Profile: implemented ContentFilteredTopic and
            the remaining functionality for QueryCondition
          - QoS: OWNERSHIP; PRESENTATION (access_scope = GROUP)

          The Content-Subscription Profile implementation required a change to
          OpenDDS's strategy for code-generation.  OpenDDS-specific code has
          been moved out of tao_idl's back-end library (enabled with -Gdcps)
          and into a code generator here in the OpenDDS repository, called
          opendds_idl (in dds/idl).  Existing applications that use MPC should
          only need to change one of the arguments which may appear in
          dcps_ts_flags: '--export=' has become '-Wb,export_macro='.
          Also, note that for footprint-sensitive applications, the content-
          subscription profile can be disabled at compile-time by setting the
          MPC feature content_subscription=0.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/udp/UdpTransport.cpp:

          Supported same transport pub-sub associations (see RT13902).
          - Added is_loopback and is_active flag to Datalink to help identify
            the active(pub) end or passive(sub) end.
          - For SimpleTCP, the links to same remote are seperated for active
            and passive side.
          - UDP was not changed as it's already seperated with the active
            and passive links.
          - Multicast transport creates two links (one link is for pubs and
            one is for subs) instead of single link per transport. As before,
            each link could have multiple sessions.
