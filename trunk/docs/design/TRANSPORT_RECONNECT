1) The test cases of lost connection.

- normal DW/DR remove on active side.
- normal DW/DR remove on passive side.
- active side upon peer disconnect
- passive side upon peer disconnect
- active side has backpressure 




Sequence for normal shutdown.
- detect lost connection
- remove association
- done

Sequence for abnormal shutdown
- detect lost connection
- wait a while to allow remove_association.
- call on_*_ before attempting to make new connection.
- active side attempts to make new connection N times
- call on_*_lost if reconnect fails.



2) Issues:

issue1:

======================================
In current implementation (as of 04/20/2006), we use the send() and recv() return value as an 
indication of whether the connection lost is caused by peer normal or abnormal shutdown, we do 
reconnecting on the active side when peer shutdown abnormally. But the recv() return value
upon the peer crashes is different on windows and linux. On linux, recv() return 0 when peer
shutdown abnormal. On windows it returns -1.


The relations of send/recv return value and shutdown/remove_association are listed:


send  ->  0 this should not happen, we will not deal with this case. 

          -1    normal shutdown     remove association  
                abnormal shutdown   not remove association
 

recv  ->  0     normal shutdown     remove association  
                abnormal shutdown   not remove association  

          -1    abnormal shutdown   not remove association 


Solution1:



In order to distinguish graceful disconnect (where the datareader or
datawriter was properly deleted/removed) from connection failures we
can add a new configuration value:

# How many milliseconds to wait before calling
# on_publication_disconencted and/or
# on_subscription_disconnected after detecting a
# connection closed or failed.
# If the remove_associations call(s) from the RepoInfo
# arrive(s) before this period then the
# connection will be abandoned and the
# callbacks will not be made.
# A value of 0 will mean that on_*_disconnected()
# listeners will be called for all disconnects;
# even if they were because the other side deleted the
# datareader/datawriter (hence it was graceful).
# The default is 1000 milliseconds.
Graceful_disconnected_period=



Here are the steps for a graceful connection and disconnection of a
subscription from the publication's point of view:
1) on_publication_matched is called.
2) the connection is established.
3) the connection close is detected
4) the remove_associations call is handled with in the
graceful_disconnected_period so on_publication_disconnected is not
called.


Here are the steps for a crashed subscriber from the publication's
point of view:
1) on_publication_matched is called.
2) the connection is established.
3) the connection close/failure is detected
4) after the graceful_disconnected_period call
on_publication_disconnected()
Note: remove_associations() will never get called because the
subscriber crashed.
5) try to reconnect 0 or more times
6) > conn_retry_attempts so call on_publication_lost
- do not attempt to reconnect any more.

Here are the steps for a disconnected connection that will be
reconnected from the publication's point of view:
1) on_publication_matched is called.
2) the connection is established.
3) the connection close/failure is detected
4) after the graceful_disconnected_period call
on_publication_disconnected()
5) try to reconnect 0 or more times
6) successfully reconnect and call on_publication_reconnected
- we are not back to a state of being between state 2 & 3.

The above steps assume that the publisher is on the active connection
side. Steps for the passive/acceptor side are similar but it is not
failing to reconnect N times that triggers a on_*_lost call but the
passive_reconnect_duration expiring.

Steps/scenarios for the subscriber's side are similar. The difference is
the connection passive side just wait for max_passive_duration_period and
then check if a new connection is established.

Solution:

Add a new control message GRACEFUL_DISCONNECT to the peer whenever the transport
initiates the connection closure. The Send/Receive strategy should check if a graceful
shutdown message is received to determine if it needs try reconnect. If recv() 
returns 0 and a graceful shutdown message is received then no reconnect notification.
If recv return 0 and has not received the graceful shutdown message then do similar
as recv return -1.


================================

Issue2:

================================

There are two scenoria a publisher reconnect to a subscriber:

- The connection is lost and then reconnected by the same datawriter. 
In this case the subscriber side needs know this publication is reconnected.

- When a publisher crashes and restart again. If the publisher is from the
  same remote address then the subscriber think it's the same datalink and 
  will notify reconnected. In this case, the subscriber should not be 
  notified the new publication is reconnected. 

The run_test.pl restart_pub show the problem.


Solution:


When the DataLink::notify is called for disconnected, make a copy of
the map in DataLink and when the DataLink::notify is called for reconnected
notification the datareader/datawriter with the ids in the copied map and clear 
the map. If the DataLink::notify is called for lost notification, notify the 
the datareader/datawriter with the ids in the original map.
