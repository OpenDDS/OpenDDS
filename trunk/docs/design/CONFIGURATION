Design document for DDS configuration of common and transport.

Objectives:
a) configuration DDS common and transports from a file
b) dynamically load transports
c) configuration design should support addition of new transports.
d) ability to switch transport types by only making configuration file changes.
e) backward compatibility is not important.
f) simplify the creation, configuraiton and use of transports



----- paul's -----
) backward compatibility is not as important as future ease of use and design/code simplicity

) how the configuration looks in a presentation - Dev Guide or slides - is important
  The current DDS transport configuration and use is too involved.
  It would be good if the SimpleTCP transport would default to being loaded.

) Allow transports to be statically linked/loaded.

) Use the service configuration name as the default factory id but also allow specification
  of multiple transport factories of the same type.
  This would avoid the need for the [transport_factory_<id>] unless there are multiple
  factories of the same type.


----- Scott ----
) consider the idea of relating the transport configuration to an factory in the configuration
  rather than in the user code.

---- design ---

Note: "Ideas:" are ideas that are not developed by the design but could enhance it.

1) regsiter and configure


  A new class will be added to framework. This class is used for concrete library registration.

  class TransportGenerator
  {
    public:

      TransportGenerator();
      virtual ~TransportGenerator();

      virtual TransportImplFactory* new_factory() = 0;
      virtual TransportConfiguration* new_configuration() = 0;
    protected:
  };


  Each concrete transport library needs provide a class inherited from the TransportGenerator class
  and implements those virtual functions in the TransportGenerator class.


  The SimpleTCP library should be defaults to be loaded automatically without specifing in svc.conf. 
  
  Each concrete transport automatically registers with TheTransportFactory via service configurator.

  The SimpleUdpTransport and some other user-implemented transport (e.g. MyTransport)
  are separated in each individual library. Each library(except SimpleTcpTransport) implements a 
  *TransportLoader that will register with the Service Configurator during static intialization. 
  When the Service_Object init() function is called, it will create a concrete TransportGenerator object and 
  register with the TheTransportFactory. 

  Example of svc.conf:

      dynamic SimpleUDPTransportLoader Service_Object * TAO:_make_DDS_SimpleUDPTransportLoader() "-type SimpleUDP"
      dynamic MyTransportLoader Service_Object * TAO:_make_DDS_MyTransportLoader() "-type MyTransport"

  When the concrete transport is loaded, the concrete transport library will create a concrete 
  ConfigurationGenerator object and register with TheTransportFactory.  TheTransportFactory will call the new_factory()
  on the ConfigurationGenerator object to create a concrete TransportImplFactory object and use the transport_name
  as the default factory id for registration. 
  Here are some examples of the TransportImplFactoryMap entry.

       "SimpleTcp"->SimpleTcpTransportImplFactory*
       "SimpleUdp"->SimpleUdpTransportImplFactory*
       "MyTransport"->MyTransportImplFactory* 

      
  After the concrete transport is registered with TheTransportFactory, the configuration data loaded by the
  Service_Participant is used to configure the new TransportImplFactory instances and the TransportImpl 
  instances.

  I have tried to make the SimpleTcpTransport in a seperate library. Since the builtin topic requires 
  SimpleTcpTransport configuration, this would require the SimpleTcpTransport library statically linked
  and hence the ddsdcps and SimpleTcpTransport library have dependency problem. So I have changed back
  to make the SimpleTcpTransport still be part of the ddsdcps library.

  The footprint for various approaches:

    1) before dds configuration:  SimpleTcp and SimpleUdp transports are in ddsdcps lib.
       TAO_DdsDcpsd.dll-> 4208kb
    2) dds configuration implementation with SimpleTcp and SimpleUdp in seperate libraries.
       SimpleTcpd.dll ->192k
       TAO_DdsDcpsd.dll->4152k
    3) dds configuration implementation with SimpleTcp be part of ddsdcps library.
       TAO_DdsDcpsd.dll->4264k

  Approach #3 is what I currently implemented.

  Note: we do not use the ACE service configuration facility to configure the transports because we want to
        be able to specify configuration of multiple transports and the ACE_Configuration file format allows
        individual sections and is more clear (you can have comments per configuration value).

  NOTE: we may need to make the TCP transport static when Built-in-topic is supported because BIT uses SimpleTCP.


2) Service Participant 


  The Service_Participant creates the ACE_Configuration object and imports the configuration file. 
  The name of the configuration file can be passed via command line option, otherwise use the 
  default name "conf.ini". After the configuration file is loaded, all values are stored in the
  ACE_Configuration object. 


The configuration file format:


[common]
DCPSDebugLevel=
DcpsInfo=
DCPSChunks=
DCPSChunkAssociationMutltiplier=
DCPSBitTransportPort=
DCPSLivelinessFactor=
DCPSBitLookupDurationSec=


[transport_impl_<id>]
# This transport_type should match the "type" argument in the svc.conf or be the
# SimpleTcp which is part of the DDSdcps lib.
transport_type=
# The local endpoint.
local_address=
#transport configuration
swap_bytes=
# Number of pre-created link (list) objects per pool for the
# "send queue" of each DataLink.
queue_links_per_pool=
# Initial number of pre-allocated pools of link (list) objects
# for the "send queue" of each DataLink.
queue_initial_pools=
#Max size (in bytes) of a packet (packet header + sample(s))
max_packet_size
# Max number of samples that should ever be in a single packet.
max_samples_per_packet
# Optimum size (in bytes) of a packet (packet header + sample(s)).
optimum_packet_size=
# This is just for SimpleTcp transport.
enable_nagle_algorithm=

Idea: get rid of the [transport_factory_<id>] and that transport factories
have # ids and just use the name from the service configuration.
This makes it simpler and there is no reason to have multiple factories so why not avoid
the complexity.  The only issue is that this would not be backward compatible.
We could make it backward compatible by having an "id=" value in the [transport_factory_<id>]
section.


The *common* section configures the values currently configured by Service_Participant via 
command line. These command line options can override the values in configuration file.
 

The [transport_impl_<id>] sections provides the informatiopn for configuring a TransportImpl.
It has the transport_type to tell which factory should be used to create the TransportImpl object
and it has the configuration specific to the concrete transport.

After the Service_Participant loads the configuration file, the ACE_Configuration is passed to
the TheTransportFactory to configure the TransportImpl. See 
void TransportFactory::load_configuration (ACE_Configuration&) for details.


3) TransportFactory:

  There are one new map and some new methods added to the TransportFactory to support the automatically registration
  of a concrete transport configuration.

  - New map:

    ConfigurationGeneratorMap: transport_type->ConfigurationGenerator* 

         The transport_type is the name of the concrete transport such as SimpleTcp, SimpleUdp, MyTransport ...
    
         Each concrete transport library needs provide a subclass of ConfigurationGenerator and implements
         the virtual functions defined in ConfigurationGenerator class.
         
         1) TransportImplFactory* new_factory () 
             
            This function returns a new concrete TransportImplFactory instance.

            e.g.

             TransportImplFactory* SimpleTcpConfigurationGenerator::new_factory ()
             {
               return new SimpleTcpFactory();
             }
         
         2) TransportConfiguration* new_configuration()

            This function returns a new concrete TransportConfiguration instance which uses the 
            default(hard coded) configurations.

            e.g.

            TransportConfiguration* SimpleTcpConfigurationGenerator::new_configuration()
             {
 		           return new SimpleTcpConfiguration ();
             }

         
    ConfigurationMap:  transport_id -> TransportConfiguration*

         


  - current existing maps that are referenced in this document.

    TransportImplFactoryMap:  factory_id->TransportImplFactory*  
      Note the factory_id is changed to be a string instead of an integer.
      
    TransportImplMap: transport_id -> TransportImpl*
      Note the transport_id is still integer type.
      

  - new methods:

     - void register_transport_generator (ACE_TString transport_type, ConfigurationGenerator*)

       This function is called when the concrete transport libraries are dynamically loaded by 
       the service configurator. This function adds the transport_type->ConfigurationGenerator* pair
       to the ConfigurationGeneratorMap in TheTransportFactory. 
       
     - void load_configuration (ACE_Configuration&)
         
       This function is called by the Service_Participant after the Service_Participant reads 
       the conf.ini to the ACE_Configuration object. TheTransportFactory uses the configuration 
       information in the ACE_Configuration object to create a TransportImpl objects.
       
       This function iterates the sections in the ACE_Configuration object. If the section is a 
       transport section then a new concrete configuration object is created and added to the 
       ConfigurationMap. The TransportImpl object is created upon the user's request which 
       means when the user call create_transport_impl () funtion.
       
        iterates over the sections.

          if it's a transport section, // The transport section has the factory_id and transport configuration info.
             TransportConfiguration* config = get_or_create_configuration (transport_id, transport_type);
             add the transport_id-> config to the configuration map

     - TransportImpl* obtain (transport_id)
        This function is previously implemented which return a ref counted TransportImpl object.

     - TransportImpl* create_transport_impl (transport_id, bool auto_config=true)
     
        This function is called when the transport_id is configured in the conf.ini. 
        If the TransportConfiguration object is not found for the transport_id in the configuration
        map then an error is reported. If the object exists then we use the transport_type information
        to create or get the TransportImplFactory object and use the factory instance to create the
        TransportImpl object.
         
        pseudo code:

        TransportConfiguration* config;
        if (configuration_map_.find (transport_id, config) != 0) // not found
           error return // the transport_id is not defined in conf.ini
        
        transport_type = config->transport_type ();
        TransportImplFactory* factory = get_or_create_factory (transport_type);
 
        TransportImpl* trans_impl = factory->create_impl ();
        bind transport_id->transport_impl to impl_map_.
        if (auto_config)
           trans_impl->configure (config);
           return trans_impl;
 

     - TransportImpl* create_transport_impl (transport_id, transport_type, bool auto_config=true)

        This function is called when the transport_id is not specified in the conf.ini.
        A new TransportConfiguration object is created when the auto_config is true. If the user 
        does not want call configure() automatically then this function will not create a new
        TransportConfiguration object. The user can call create_configuration() afterwards
        and then call configure().

        pseudo code:

          TransportImplFactory* factory = get_or_create_factory (transport_type);
 
          TransportImpl* trans_impl = factory->create_impl ();
          if (auto_config)
            TransportConfiguration* config = create_configuration (transport_id, transport_type);
 
            trans_impl->configure (config);
          return trans_impl;
            

     - TransportConfiguration* get_configuration (transport_id)

       This function is called if the transport_id is configured in the configuration file.
       The TransportConfiguration object is created during the time of Service_Participant 
       initialization and added to the configuration map.
       If the transport_id is not configured then an error is reported.

       pseudo code:

       TransportConfiguration* config;
       if (configuration_map_.find (transport_id, config) == 0) // found
         return config;
       else
         error.
       
     - TransportConfiguration* create_configuration (transport_id, transport_type)
  
       This function is to create a new TransportConfiguration object from the transport_type
       and bind to the configuration_map_. If the transport_id is already in the map then an
       error is reported.
 
       pseudo code:

       TransportGenerator* generator;
       if (generator_map_.find (transport_type, generator) ==0)
           config = generator->new_configuration ();    
           bind transport_id->config to configuration map.
       else
          error. //The transport type is not registered.


     - TransportConfiguration* get_or_create_configuration (transport_id, transport_type="")
 
       This function check if the configuration map for transport_id. If it's already created
       then return it. Otherwise use the provided transport_type to create one.

       pseudo code:

       TransportConfiguration* config;
       if (configuration_map_.find (transport_id, config) == 0) // found
         // check if there is conflict between the user provided transport_type and in the 
         // TransportConfiguration object.
       else
         create_configuration (transport_id, transport_type);


     - TransportImplFactory* get_or_create_factory (transport_type)

        This function is called to provide the TransportImplFactory object for the given transport_type.
        Note we have one TranportImplpFactory instance per transport_type. The TransportImplFactory instance 
        is registered in the TransportImplFactory map using transport_type as it's id.

        This function looks the TransportImplFactory map for the "transport_type" id. If the 
        TransportImplFactory object is created already then the reference is returned. 
        Otherwise a new TransportImplFactory object is created using the generator of the transport_type.
   

        pseudo code:

        if (TransportImplFactoryMap->find (transport_type, factory_impl) == 0)
           return factory_impl;
        
        TransportGenerator* generator;
        if (generator_map_.find (transport_type, generator) ==0)
           factory_impl = generator->new_factory ();    
        else
           error // transport_type is not registered.

        return factory_impl;
       

   
5)  Scenarios for using dds configurations:


   - single step to create/configure TransportImpl when transport_id is configured in the conf.ini 

     TransportImpl* trans = TheTransportFactory->create_transport_impl (transport_id, AUTO_CONFIG);


        e.g.        DevGuideExamples\DDS\Messenger
   
            - Configure via conf.ini using SimpleTcp, run run_test.pl
            - Change to use SimpleUdp in conf.ini and run "run_test.pl udp"

   - single step to create/configure TransportImpl when transport_id is NOT configured in the conf.ini

     // using the transport type's default configuration (hardcoded).
     TransportImpl* trans = TheTransportFactory->create_transport_impl (transport_id, transport_type, OpenDDS::DCPS::AUTO_CONFIG);
   

	e.g.     performance-tests\DCPS\SimpleLatency


   - the user needs overwrite the configuration in the conf.ini

     TransportImpl* trans = TheTransportFactory->create_transport_impl (transport_id, DONT_AUTO_CONFIG);
     TransportConfiguration* config = TheTransportFactory->get_configuration (transport_id)
     //overwrite the configuration in the conf.ini.
     config->... = ...
     trans->configure (config)


        e.g.    performance-tests\DCPS\TCPListenerTest


   - the user does not use file configuration and the test code overwrites the default hardcoded 
     configuration. Most tests configure in this way.
     
     TransportImpl* trans = TheTransportFactory->create_transport_impl (transport_id, transport_type, DONT_AUTO_CONFIG);
     TransportConfiguration* config = TheTransportFactory->create_configuration (transport_id)
     //overwrite the configuration in the conf.ini.
     config->... = ...
     trans->configure (config)

 

6) Allow the transport statically linked.

   To allow the transport statically linked, the user application needs include the header
   file such as SimpleUdp.h and the specify the project depend on the SimplUdp lib.

   
   e.g of svc.conf:

      static DCPS_SimpleUdpLoader "-type SimpleUdp"

   See tests\transport\udp_simple as an example.
