General:
A "wchar" build of ACE uses wide-character APIs (where available) to
invoke operating system functions and also (for the most part) presents
a wide-character API to the application using ACE.
Enable this with "#define ACE_USES_WCHAR 1" in config.h and "uses_wchar=1" in
default.features.  DOC group and OCI 1.6a have full support for wchar,
OCI 1.5a supports it in the core but not the TAO tests/examples.
One execption is that (in all versions) the TAO ImR and IfR services
will not build with uses_wchar=1.

How does it work?
ACE introduces a typedef, ACE_TCHAR, which is the "switchable" character type.
When the build is set in "wchar" mode, ACE_TCHAR resolves to wchar_t otherwise
it's simply char.  The ACE_TEXT macro adds an L to the front of a
string/character literal in wchar builds (C++ wchar_t literals are of the form
L'x' and wide-string literals are L"foo").
Not every string in the program needs to be switchable.  For example, CORBA,
and therefore both TAO and OpenDDS define distinct character and string types
for wide and narrow (in IDL: string vs. wstring).
In general, the strings that go directly to ACE (or from ACE) should be
switchable.  This includes argv and argument parsing in general (see below).
If the application is storing such ACE-influenced strings like file names,
command line parameters, and network address/port strings, it will be easier
to keep them in switchable-string format, either with ACE_TString or
std::basic_string<ACE_TCHAR>.


main signature:
int ACE_TMAIN(int argc, ACE_TCHAR* argv[])
(#include "ace/OS_main.h" if ACE_TMAIN is unknown)
(#include "ace/ace_wchar.h" if ACE_TCHAR is unknown)
Please do not split this over multiple lines, so that grep can find it.

switchable string literal:
const ACE_TCHAR* str = ACE_TEXT("-Samples");

conversions:
(these are really macros)
char* ACE_TEXT_ALWAYS_CHAR(const ACE_TCHAR* str)
wchar_t* ACE_TEXT_ALWAYS_WCHAR(const ACE_TCHAR* str)
ACE_TCHAR* ACE_TEXT_CHAR_TO_TCHAR(const char* str)
ACE_TCHAR* ACE_TEXT_WCHAR_TO_TCHAR(const wchar_t* str)
ACE_TCHAR* ACE_TEXT_ANTI_TO_TCHAR(const ACE_ANTI_TCHAR* str)

The results are a temporary string so either pass it directly
to a function or save the result in a std::basic_string<ACE_TCHAR>
or an ACE_TString (ACE_CString / ACE_WString).

ACE Logging:
The log format string itself does *not* need to be switchable, but making it
switchable means that wide systems will not pay a performance penalty to 
convert the string at runtime.  Core library code should be switchable.  Tests
that aren't performance sensitive can just be left with narrow format strings.
The C++ language prohibits concatenating different types of literals by
writing the two literals next to each-other.  For example:
"foo" "bar"   // legal
L"foo" "bar"  // illegal!
L"foo" L"bar" // legal
In ACE-land this translates to:  ACE_TEXT("foo") "bar" // illegal!
The ACE log format specifiers must be changed to accomodate the different types
of strings:
%s - switchable string (ACE_TCHAR*)
%C - narrow string (char*); %c - narrow character (char)
%W - wide string (wchar_t*); %w - wide character (wchar_t)

Be careful with calling std::[sn]printf() or ACE_OS::[sn]printf() using strings
of ACE_TCHARs.  Windows and UNIX use different formatting characters for wide
strings with these functions.  Instead, convert the ACE_TCHARs (or wchar_t's)
into narrow character strings before passing them to a function from the printf
family.
