LIFESPAN
(RxO == N/A ; Mutable == YES)
[ Topic, DataWriter ]

The default value is lifespan == infinite.

This policy determines the lifetime of all data written to a DataWriter.
The expiration of the lifetime of data results in its removal from all
TRANSIENT and PERSISTENT caches as well as any data stored in DataReader
caches.

This policy is not considered during the establishment of associations
between DataReaders and DataWriters.  The value of this policy may be
changed at any time.  Changes to this policy affect only data written
after the change.

Implementing this policy requires that the lifespan of each sample of
instance data is transmitted and stored along with it.  This can be done
for each sample as it is sent or the lifespan of each DataWriter for
an instance can be stored by the associated DataReaders and the stored
values used for calculations.  The SOURCE_TIMESTAMP is required and must
be transmitted for each sample in either case.

All data caches: TRANSIENT or PERSISTENT data caches for the DURABILITY
policy an the DataReader caches must determine whether a data sample
should be retained or removed.  This can be done when the data is examined
rather than continuously polling or scheduling expiration events.  It is
up to the individual cache implementation to determine when resources
should be reclaimed.

Expiration is to be computed by using the lifespan value along with the
SOURCE_TIMESTAMP information for the data sample.  The specification
allows the DESTINATION_TIMESTAMP to be used in the computation if the
clocks are not synchronized between the two ends.

The effect of expiration is that the data may no longer be accessed after
expiration has occured.  It is left to the implementation to reclaim
any resources associated with the expired sample at its own discretion.

In the case where more than one DataWriter is providing data samples
to a single subscription (different instances or shared ownership)
the LIFESPAN value must be consistent between the DataWriters.  This
constraint is not from the specification but is OpenDDS implementation
specific.  If we want to allow different LIFESPAN values for data from
the different DataWriters, then we would need to mark each sample with
its origin and use only the LIFESPAN policy value from that DataWriter.
While the receiving transport has this information in the form of the
publication Id in the sample header, it is not currently propagated up
to the subscribing DataReader.

Synchronization between clocks on the sending machine and the receiving
machine is assumed.  It is beyond the scope of DDS to provide a solution
for unsynchronized participants in a data exchange.

Implementation notes:

  The simplest implementation is to depend on the source timestamp and
  pass the LIFESPAN policy value during creation of the association so
  that the destination knows the lifespan and can calculate whether a
  data sample has expired before allowing access to the data.

  Expired data will not have any StatusCondition set due to expiration.
  The SAMPLE_REJECTED condition is associated with resource limits
  only, while the SAMPLE_LOST condition implies that a sample was never
  received.  None of these reasons applys when a sample is expired.

  DataWriter
    QoS.LIFESPAN.duration==<any>

    During resource management the lifespan of any given sample is
    checked for expiration, and if expired the sample is released back
    to the resource pool.  No access of data after expiration is allowed.

  DataReader
    QoS.LIFESPAN.duration==<any>

    On access of data samples (read/take), or during resource management,
    the lifespan of any given sample is checked for expiration, and if
    expired the sample is released by to the resource pool.  No access
    of data after expiration is allowed.
