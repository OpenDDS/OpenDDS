Overall test configuration requires that each process be identified.
Each process can then be configured using the configuration file format
below.  The overall test topology is then completely determined by the
Topic and Partition values for individual publications and subscriptions.

#
# Individual scenario definition configuration file contents are
# described below.  Files with this format can be specified to a
# testprocess executable and will configure that process to create the
# specified entities with the specified characteristics.
