What does the program do?
----------------------------
  The test program basically carries out synchronous hand-shake operation, with a publisher sending out 200 byte messages with a sequence number and a subscriber sending back the same sequence number as an acknowledgement. Note that you should keep in mind that the publisher process in this case is also a subscriber to the subscriber node (subscribe to AckMessage topic). As a result you will see in the codes, the initialization of subscriber and publisher is very complex. Check out the codes for details.


  To run the program properly, you NEED to be the root or in the sudoer list. The way i run the program is to use sudo.
