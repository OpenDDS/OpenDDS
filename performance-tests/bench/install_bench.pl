# This script is purposed to install the build of Bench to a destination of choice provided on the
# command line with the --dest paramenter. At the destination chosen, a 'bin' and 'lib' directory
# is created with a test_controller, node_controller, and worker from the build copied to 'bin'.
# The libs from the various support libraries of Bench are collected from the build tree of Bench
# and copied over to the 'lib' directory created in the destination. Subsequent run of Bench by a
# user session will need to add the {destination path}/bin to the PATH environment and the
# {destination path}/lib to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH prior to running a Bench test.
# IMPORTANT: Since this is taken from an OpenDDS build, the 'DDS_ROOT' environment variable must
# set prior to running this script.
