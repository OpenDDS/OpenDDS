        * tests/DCPS/KeyTest:

          Re-added from trunk.  Merging this directory didn't work so it was
          removed in the last commit.

        * Merged from trunk r4455 through r4906.
          Previous work on this branch was incorporated in the trunk as of
          Wed May 18 21:32:29 UTC 2011  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>
          and therefore the previous BranchChangeLog entries have been cleared.
          They can now be found in docs/history/ChangeLog-RTPS-1.
