        * MPC/config/dcps.mpb:
        * MPC/config/dds_taolib.mpb:

          portableserver should also be excluded when building
          opendds_safety_profile.

        * MPC/config/dds_taolib.mpb:

          New feature, to optionally inherit taolib

        * MPC/config/dcps.mpb:
        * dds/DdsDcps.mpc:

          Inherit from dds_taolib, so that taolib is skipped for
          safety profile builds.

        * MPC/config/dcps_optional_features.mpb:
        * dds/idl/opendds_idl.mpc:

          MPC feature for Safety Profile.  Set no_opendds_safety_profile=0.

        * bin/dcps_tests.lst:
        * tests/DCPS/Reliability/Boilerplate.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/Reliability/run_test.pl:

          Revert prior change to Reliabilty and disable the test on this
          branch.  Other problems with default History and non-default
          Resource Limits need to be resolved in trunk first before we can
          adapt this test to DDS minimum profile (only default History).

          Adapted tests to the Minimum Profile build (in particular, removing
          history depth either all the time or when the profile is disabled).
          The following tests need more work: Reliability, Rejects,
          ManualAssertLiveliness.

          Initial support for the Future Airborne Capability Environment,
          specifically the Transport Services Segment API.  See face/README.txt
          for details.  Since there is no support for a config file in this
          version, the library is hard-coded to use the types in the Messenger
          test and the configurations for that test.
