The files in this directory apply to version 1.1 of OpenDDS and
many of the modeling elements may no longer be applicable, but is retained
for historical reasons.

DDS.uml
a UML model created using StarUML(Open Source free UML modeling tool)
it uses Analysis.unt, InDepthOverview.unt, and Overview.unt.
   After opening DDS.uml with StarUML, in the ModelExplorer under "Use
   Case Model" you will find "Overview" (an overview of how the publish
   and subscribe mechanisms work) and  "In Depth Overview" (a more in
   depth overview, aimed at those who will be making changes to DDS).
   Under "Analysis Model" there are some Class Diagrams for some of the
   major classes in the system.

DDS.xmi

which coincides with UML1.3, so some of the model information is lost)
