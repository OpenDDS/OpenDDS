The user is allowed to "write" before all existing associations are fully established.
  - data is dropped.
  - Is part of why BIT is flaky.
  - need to add "ready" feedback so association is know to be fully
    established before returning from creating a writer.
  - this could cause problems - slow, ?deadlock
  - what if the connection cannot be established?
  -- from "projects\AdvancedAcousticConcepts/doc/open_issues.txt"
  create_datawriter() does not wait for full association esablishment* so
  a write shortly after creating the datawriter may be dropped on the publisher
  side because add_associations() has not completed on the publisher side.
  The sample may also be dropped on the subscriber side because the connection
  exists between the publisher and subscriber but the associations have not
  been mapped on the subscriber side.
