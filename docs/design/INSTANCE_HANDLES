Instance handles:

  "local identifiers for objects that live within the global data space."

This is a good working definition and covers all of the cases which
need to be handled by the opaque handle values.  The global data space
in this case consists of the entire reachable DDS service; both local
and remote service entities.

The following methods and data structures use the InstanceHandle_t
opaque value:

  DDS::Entity
    Returns handle value:
      InstanceHandle_t = get_instance_handle()

  DDS::DomainParticipant
    Returns handle value:
      get_discovered_participants(inout: InstanceHandle_t)
      get_discovered_topics(inout: InstanceHandle_t)

    Requires handle value:
      ignore_participant(InstanceHandle_t)
      ignore_topic(InstanceHandle_t)
      ignore_publication(InstanceHandle_t)
      ignore_subscription(InstanceHandle_t)
      get_discovered_participant_data(..., InstanceHandle_t)
      get_discovered_topic_data(..., InstanceHandle_t)
      contains_entity(InstanceHandle_t)

  DDS::DataWriter
    Returns handle value:
      InstanceHandle_t = register_instance(...)
      InstanceHandle_t = register_instance_w_timestamp(...)
      InstanceHandle_t = lookup_instance(...)
      get_matched_subscriptions(inout: InstanceHandle_t)

    Requires handle value:
      unregister_instance(..., InstanceHandle_t)
      unregister_instance_w_timestamp(..., InstanceHandle_t, ...)
      get_key_value(..., InstanceHandle_t)
      write(..., InstanceHandle_t)
      write_w_timestamp(..., InstanceHandle_t, ...)
      dispose(..., InstanceHandle_t)
      dispose_w_timestamp(..., InstanceHandle_t, ...)
      get_matched_subscription_data(..., InstanceHandle_t)

  DDS::DataReader
    Returns handle value:
      InstanceHandle_t = lookup_instance(...)
      get_matched_publications(inout: InstanceHandle_t)

    Requires handle value:
      read_instance(..., InstanceHandle_t, ...)
      take_instance(..., InstanceHandle_t, ...)
      read_next_instance(..., InstanceHandle_t, ...)
      take_next_instance(..., InstanceHandle_t, ...)
      read_next_instance_w_condition(..., InstanceHandle_t, ...)
      take_next_instance_w_condition(..., InstanceHandle_t, ...)
      get_key_value(..., InstanceHandle_t)
      get_matched_publication_data(..., InstanceHandle_t)

  DDS::SampleInfo
    instance_handle publication_handle

  DDS::LivelinessChangedStatus
    last_publication_handle

  DDS::OfferedDeadlineMissedStatus
    last_instance_handle

  DDS::RequestedDeadlineMissedStatus
    last_instance_handle

  DDS::SampleRejectedStatus
    last_instance_handle

  DDS::PublicationMatchedStatus
    last_subscription_handle

  DDS::SubscriptionMatchedStatus
    last_publication_handle

For the DataWriter and DataReader, InstanceHandle_t values
represent a specific key value for that writer or reader.  For the
Entity::get_instance_handle() and DomainParticipant::contains_entity()
methods, the InstanceHandle_t value represents a local Entity within
the scope of the DomainParticipant.

NOTE: Even though there is no inheritance from Entity shown for DataReader
      and DataWriter in the specification, the IDL included there for
      the PSM clearly shows this relationship, so these are considered
      Entities.

For the SampleInfo and various Status variable fields, the
InstanceHandle_t values represent either a DataReader key value
(instance_handle, last_instance_handle) or an Entity within the entire
reachable DDS service (publication_handle, last_publication_handle,
last_subscription_handle).

The DDS specification, formal/07-01-01 version 1.2, clearly links the
two different uses of these handles:

  7.1.2.2.1.31 contains_entity
  ...
  The instance handle for an Entity may be obtained from built-in
  topic data, from various statuses, or from the Entity operation
  get_instance_handle.

This means that an application should be able to read a Builtin Topic
sample, determine its SampleInfo::instance_handle, and use that in a
call to any of the API methods that require an instance handle.  If that
handle is not suitable for that call, the method implementation should
reject its use by returning the RETCODE_BAD_PARAMETER status code.

Synthesizing the above information we see that the scope of any individual
InstanceHandle_t value is within at least a single DomainParticipant
and that values obtained via get_instance_handle() or from SampleInfo
or reader or writer methods need to be consistent and match where they
refer to the same Entity or data key value.

The handle values for a unique data key value used to identify instances
in readers and writers are usable only in the reader or writer from which
the handle was obtained.  For example, if a writer is used to register a
sample with a key value and returns an instance handle representing that
instance, that handle is only valid within the scope of that writer.
To access the same unique data key value from a reader, or any other
writer, a lookup_instance() call can be made to find the handle value
valid within that reader or writer.

OpenDDS generates all InstanceHandle_t values within the scope of a
containing DomainParticipant Entity.  Each contained Entity and unique
data key value instance in each writer and reader will have a unique
value within the participant.

Values representing Entities obtained from the data sample key values,
a DataWriter or DataReader lookup_instance() call, from a DataReader
SampleInfo value, or from a Communication Status variable field value,
must correspond to the Entity get_instance_handle() value obtained from
the corresponding Entity where it is available in the same scope (that is,
the Entity referred to is contained within the same DomainParticipant).

The specification suggests, but does not require, that the type of the
opaque handle values be a CORBA::Long.  OpenDDS follows this suggestion.

A consequence of maintaining the handle values as unique within a
participant is that the total number of Entities plus data instances in
all readers and writers may not exceed the maximum allowed value of the
handle type.  For OpenDDS this is a 32 bit value.  Note that this
includes all values generated, even if they are no longer actively
participating in the operation of the middleware (disposed instances,
destroyed Entities).  OpenDDS does not currently implement a value reuse
mechanism once the handle value type saturates.

The following methods are part of the instance handle management
implementation of OpenDDS:

  InstanceHandleGenerator
    - Class provides the Sequence implementation used to generate
      unique handle values.

  DomainParticipantImpl::participant_handles_
    - Object of InstanceHandleGenerator used as the generating Sequence
      for handles.

  DomainParticipantImpl::handles_,handles_protector_
    - Mapping of GUID_t values to instance handles and lock for guarding
      access to the container.

  InstanceHandle_t = DomainParticipant::get_handle(GUID_t)
    - If the GUID_t value represents and Entity, an index is searched for
      that Entity and any existing handle value returned.  Otherwise a
      unique new handle value is generated.  The new value is stored in
      the index if it represents an Entity.

  InstanceHandle_t = DataWriterImpl::get_next_instance()
    - Obtains a handle value for unique data key value instances as they
      are created.

  InstanceHandle_t = DataReaderImpl::get_next_handle(BuiltinTopicKey_t)
    - If the reader is for a BuiltinTopic Topic, then a handle is
      obtained representing the Entity described in the sample with the
      given key value.  Otherwise a unique new handle value is generated.

  BuiltinTopicKey_t = keyFromSample<T>(T* sample)
    - Template function to extract BuiltinTopicKey_t values from
      BuiltinTopic data samples.

Instance handles, BIT Keys, and GUIDs (aka RepoIds) are all related:
- Starting from an Instance Handle:
  - Convert to a GUID using DomainParticipantImpl::get_repoid()
  - Convert to a BIT Key using BIT_Helper_1 or the BIT Data Reader
- Starting from a GUID (aka RepoId):
  - Convert to an Instance Handle using DomainParticipantImpl::get_handle()
  - Direct conversion to a BIT Key is not supported (first get the handle)
- Starting from a BIT Key:
  - Convert to a GUID using Discovery::bit_key_to_repo_id()
    - The relevant Discovery object can be obtained from TheServiceParticipant
  - Convert to an Instance Handle using the BIT Data Reader
