*** General implementation changes.

DomainParticipant::create_publisher()
DomainParticipant::create_subscriber()
Publisher::set_qos()
Subscriber::set_qos()
  - handle access_scope==GROUP.  Do we want to reject this value or allow
    it and return the correct error for the methods when it would affect
    behavior?

Subscriber::begin_access()
  - track how many times this is called; return OK.  This is probably a
    new Atomic int member.

Subscriber::end_access()
  - match begin_access() calls; return PRECONDITION_NOT_MET if no match;
    otherwise return OK.

CompatibleQOS( PublisherQos, SubscriberQos) (dds/InfoRepo/DCPS_Utils.cpp)
  - implement compatibility check for PRESENTATION policies.

CompatibleQOS( Pub*, Sub*) (dds/InfoRepo/DCPS_Utils.cpp)
  - add call to Qos compatibility checking implemented above.

========================================================================
*** 5) access_scope==TOPIC;    coherent_access==true

Publisher::begin_coherent_changes()
  - track how many times this is called. This is probably a new Atomic
    int member.
  - Set the 'coherent' flag on all samples sent by all DataWriters
    contained by this Publisher.

Publisher::end_coherent_changes()
  - match begin_coherent_changes() calls.  Only act when there are no

  - Set 'incoherent' flag on all received samples that have the
    'coherent' flag set when recieved.
  - Ignore all samples that have the 'incoherent' flag set when forming
    the output list of samples.

DataReader::data_received()
  - Process END_COHERENT_SET control messages by clearing all of the
    'incoherent' flags for samples of all instances received from the
    same publication (DataWriter).
    
    NOTE: If the publication information is not available for each sample
          (which it should be since that is set in the SampleInfo),
          then we will need to add this information to the stored data
          about the sample.

*** 6) access_scope==TOPIC;    ordered_access==true

DataReader::rake()
  - interleave output list from different instances according to
    DESTINATION_ORDER sort order.  I *think* this might be similar to the
    "ORDER BY" implementation that is already present.

    NOTE: The ordering is only required for samples from the same DataWriter.

========================================================================
*** From the Publication Module section (7.1.2.4):

7.1.2.4.1.10 Publisher::begin_coherent_changes

This operation requests that the application will begin a ‘coherent
set’ of modifications using DataWriter objects attached to the
Publisher. The ‘coherent set’ will be completed by a matching call
to end_coherent_changes.

A ‘coherent set’ is a set of modifications that must be propagated
in such a way that they are interpreted at the receivers’ side as a
consistent set of modifications; that is, the receiver will only be able
to access the data after all the modifications in the set are available
at the receiver end[12].

A connectivity change may occur in the middle of a set of coherent
changes; for example, the set of partitions used by the Publisher or one
of its Subscribers may change, a late-joining DataReader may appear on
the network, or a communication failure may occur. In the event that such
a change prevents an entity from receiving the entire set of coherent
changes, that entity must behave as if it had received none of the set.

These calls can be nested. In that case, the coherent set terminates
only with the last call to end_coherent_ changes.

The support for ‘coherent changes’ enables a publishing application to
change the value of several data-instances that could belong to the same
or different topics and have those changes be seen ‘atomically’ by the
readers. This is useful in cases where the values are inter-related. For
example, if there are two data-instances representing the ‘altitude’
and ‘velocity vector’ of the same aircraft and both are changed,
it may be useful to communicate those values in a way the reader can
see both together; otherwise, it may e.g., erroneously interpret that
the aircraft is on a collision course.

Footnotes:
  12. This does not imply that the middleware has to encapsulate all the
      modifications in a single message; it only implies that the
      receiving applications will behave as if this was the case.

7.1.2.4.1.11 Publisher::end_coherent_changes

This operation terminates the ‘coherent set’ initiated by the
matching call to begin_coherent_ changes. If there is no matching
call to begin_coherent_ changes, the operation will return the error
PRECONDITION_NOT_MET.

Possible error codes returned in addition to the standard ones:
PRECONDITION_NOT_MET.

========================================================================
*** From the Subscription Module section (7.1.2.5):

7.1.2.5.2.8 Subscriber::begin_access

This operation indicates that the application is about to access the
data samples in any of the DataReader objects attached to the Subscriber.

The application is required to use this operation only if PRESENTATION
QosPolicy of the Subscriber to which the DataReader belongs has the
access_scope set to ‘GROUP.’

In the aforementioned case, the operation begin_access must be called
prior to calling any of the sample-accessing operations, namely:
get_datareaders on the Subscriber and read, take, read_w_condition,
take_w_condition on any DataReader. Otherwise the sample-accessing
operations will return the error PRECONDITION_NOT_MET. Once the
application has finished accessing the data samples it must call
end_access.

It is not required for the application to call begin_access/end_access if
the PRESENTATION QosPolicy has the access_scope set to something other
than ‘GROUP.’ Calling begin_access/end_access in this case is not
considered an error and has no effect.

The calls to begin_access/end_access may be nested. In that case, the
application must call end_access as many times as it called begin_access.

Possible error codes returned in addition to the standard ones:
PRECONDITION_NOT_MET.

7.1.2.5.2.9 Subscriber::end_access

Indicates that the application has finished accessing the data samples
in DataReader objects managed by the Subscriber.

This operation must be used to ‘close’ a corresponding begin_access.

After calling end_access the application should no longer access any
of the Data or SampleInfo elements returned from the sample-accessing
operations. This call must close a previous call to begin_access otherwise
the operation will return the error PRECONDITION_NOT_MET.

Possible error codes returned in addition to the standard ones:
PRECONDITION_NOT_MET.

7.1.2.5.2.10 Subscriber::get_datareaders

This operation allows the application to access the DataReader objects
that contain samples with the specified sample_states, view_states,
and instance_states.

If the PRESENTATION QosPolicy of the Subscriber to which the DataReader
belongs has the access_scope set to ‘GROUP.’ This operation should
only be invoked inside a begin_access/end_access block. Otherwise it
will return the error PRECONDITION_NOT_MET.

Depending on the setting of the PRESENTATION QoS policy (see Section
7.1.3.6, “PRESENTATION,” on page 110), the returned collection of
DataReader objects may be a ‘set’ containing each DataReader at most
once in no specified order, or a ‘list’ containing each DataReader
one or more times in a specific order.

     1. If PRESENTATION access_scope is INSTANCE or TOPIC, the returned
        collection is a ‘set.’

     2. If PRESENTATION access_scope is GROUP and ordered_access is set
        to TRUE, then the returned collection is a ‘list.’

This difference is due to the fact that, in the second situation it is
required to access samples belonging to different DataReader objects in
a particular order. In this case, the application should process each
DataReader in the same order it appears in the ‘list’ and read or
take exactly one sample from each DataReader. The patterns that an
application should use to access data is fully described in Section
7.1.2.5.1, “Access to the data,” on page 62.

========================================================================
*** From the DataReader::read() description (7.1.2.5.3.8):

This operation accesses a collection of Data values from the
DataReader. The size of the returned collection will be limited to the
specified max_samples. The properties of the data_values collection
and the setting of the PRESENTATION QoS policy (see Section 7.1.3.6,
“PRESENTATION,” on page 110) may impose further limits on the size
of the returned ‘list.’

     1. If PRESENTATION access_scope is INSTANCE, then the returned
        collection is a ‘list’ where samples belonging to the same
        data-instance are consecutive.

     2. If PRESENTATION access_scope is TOPIC and ordered_access is
        set to FALSE, then the returned collection is a ‘list’ where
        samples belonging to the same data-instance are consecutive.

     3. If PRESENTATION access_scope is TOPIC and ordered_access is set
        to TRUE, then the returned collection is a ‘list’ were samples
        belonging to the same instance may or may not be consecutive. This
        is because to preserve order it may be necessary to mix samples
        from different instances.

     4. If PRESENTATION access_scope is GROUP and ordered_access is
        set to FALSE, then the returned collection is a ‘list’ where
        samples belonging to the same data instance are consecutive.

     5. If PRESENTATION access_scope is GROUP and ordered_access is
        set to TRUE, then the returned collection contains at most one
        sample. The difference in this case is due to the fact that it is
        required that the application is able to read samples belonging
        to different DataReader objects in a specific order.

In any case, the relative order between the samples of one instance is
consistent with the DESTINATION_ORDER QosPolicy:

    • If DESTINATION_ORDER is BY_RECEPTION_TIMESTAMP, samples belonging
      to the same instances will appear in the relative order in which
      they were received (FIFO, earlier samples ahead of the later
      samples).

    • If DESTINATION_ORDER is BY_SOURCE_TIMESTAMP, samples belonging
      to the same instances will appear in the relative order implied
      by the source_timestamp (FIFO, smaller values of source_timestamp
      ahead of the larger values).

========================================================================
*** From the DataReader::take() description (7.1.2.5.3.9):

This operation accesses a collection of data-samples from the DataReader
and a corresponding collection of SampleInfo structures. The operation
will return either a ‘list’ of samples or else a single sample. This
is controlled by the PRESENTATION QosPolicy using the same logic as for
the read operation (see Section 7.1.2.5.3.8).

========================================================================
*** From the Data Access Patterns description (7.1.2.5.1.9):

To access data coherently, or in order, the PRESENTATION QoS (explained in
Section 7.1.3.6, “PRESENTATION,” on page 110) must be set properly
and the application must conform to the access pattern described
below. Otherwise, the application will still access the data but will
not necessarily see all coherent changes together, nor will it see the
changes in the proper order.

There is a general pattern that will provide both ordered and coherent
access across multiple DataReaders. This pattern will work for any
settings of the PRESENTATION QoS. Simpler patterns may also work for
specific settings of the QoS as described below.

1. General pattern to access samples as a coherent set and/or in order
   across DataReader entities. This case applies when PRESENTATION QoS
   specifies “access_scope=GROUP.”

     • Upon notification to the SubscriberListener or following
       the similar StatusCondition[18] enabled, the application uses
       begin_access on the Subscriber to indicate it will be accessing
       data through the Subscriber.

     • Then it calls get get_datareaders on the Subscriber to get the
       list of DataReader objects where data samples are available.

     • Following this it calls read or take on each DataReader in
       the same order returned to access all the relevant changes in
       the DataReader.

     • Once it has called read or take on all the readers, it calls
       end_access.

Note that if the PRESENTATION QoS policy specifies ordered_access=TRUE,
then the list of DataReaders may return the same reader several times. In
this manner the correct sample order can be maintained among samples in
different DataReader objects.

2. Specialized pattern if no order or coherence needs to be maintained
   across DataReader entities.This case applies if PRESENTATION QoS
   policy specifies access_scope something other than GROUP.

     • In this case, it is not required for the application to call
       begin_access and end_access. However, doing so is not an error
       and it will have no effect.

     • The application accesses the data by calling read or take[19]
       on each DataReader in any order it wishes.

     • The application can still call get_datareaders to determine
       which readers have data to be read, but it does not need to read
       all of them, nor read them in a particular order. Furthermore,
       the return of get_datareaders will be logically a “set” in
       the sense that the same reader will not appear twice, and the
       order of the readers returned is not specified.

3. Specialized pattern if the application accesses the data within the
   SubscriberListener. This case applies regardless of the PRESENTATION
   QoS policy when the application accesses the data inside the
   listener’s implementation of the on_data_on_readers operation.

     • Similar to the previous case (2 above), it is not required for
       the application to call begin_access and end_access, but doing
       so has no effect.

     • The application can access data by calling read or take[20] on
       each DataReader in any order it wishes.

     • The application can also delegate the accessing of the data
       to the DataReaderListener objects installed on each DataReader
       by calling notify_datareaders.

     • Similar to the previous case (2 above), the application can
       still call get_datareaders to determine which readers have data to
       be read, but it does not need to read all of them, nor read them
       in a particular order. Furthermore, the return of get_datareaders
       will be logically a ‘set.’

========================================================================
*** From the QoS Policy Table (7.1.3):

PRESENTATION (Publisher, Subscriber), RxO, not changeable
   An “access_scope”: INSTANCE, TOPIC, GROUP
   And two booleans: “coherent_access” “ordered_access”

Specifies how the samples representing changes to data instances are
presented to the subscribing application. This policy affects the
application’s ability to specify and receive coherent changes and to
see the relative order of changes. access_scope determines the largest
scope spanning the entities for which the order and coherency of changes
can be preserved. The two booleans control whether coherent access and
ordered access are supported within the scope access_scope.

access_scope==INSTANCE   (this is the default access_scope)
  Scope spans only a single instance.  Indicates that changes to one
  instance need not be coherent nor ordered with respect to changes to
  any other instance. In other words, order and coherent changes apply
  to each instance separately.

access_scope==TOPIC
  Scope spans to all instances within the same DataWriter (or Data
  Reader), but not across instances in different DataWriter (or Data
  Reader).

access_scope==GROUP [optional - Object Model Profile]
  Scope spans to all instances belonging to DataWriter (or DataReader)
  entities within the same Publisher (or Subscriber).

coherent_access   (the default setting of coherent_access is FALSE)
  Specifies support coherent access.  That is, the ability to group a
  set of changes as a unit on the publishing end such that they are
  received as a unit at the subscribing end.

ordered_access   (the default setting of ordered_access is FALSE)
  Specifies support for ordered access to the samples received at the
  subscription end. That is, the ability of the subscriber to see changes
  in the same order as they occurred on the publishing end.

========================================================================
*** From the QoS Policy description (7.1.3.6):

This QoS policy controls the extent to which changes to data-instances
can be made dependent on each other and also the kind of dependencies
that can be propagated and maintained by the Service.

The setting of coherent_access controls whether the Service will preserve
the groupings of changes made by the publishing application by means of
the operations begin_coherent_change and end_coherent_change.

The setting of ordered_access controls whether the Service will preserve
the order of changes.

The granularity is controlled by the setting of the access_scope.

If coherent_access is set, then the access_scope controls the maximum
extent of coherent changes. The behavior is as follows:

     • If access_scope is set to INSTANCE, the use of
       begin_coherent_change and end_coherent_change has no effect on how
       the subscriber can access the data because with the scope limited
       to each instance, changes to separate instances are considered
       independent and thus cannot be grouped by a coherent change.

     • If access_scope is set to TOPIC, then coherent changes
       (indicated by their enclosure within calls to begin_coherent_change
       and end_coherent_change) will be made available as such to
       each remote DataReader independently. That is, changes made to
       instances within each individual DataWriter will be available
       as coherent with respect to other changes to instances in that
       same DataWriter, but will not be grouped with changes made to
       instances belonging to a different DataWriter.

     • If access_scope is set to GROUP, then coherent changes made to
       instances through a DataWriter attached to a common Publisher
       are made available as a unit to remote subscribers.

If ordered_access is set, then the access_scope controls the maximum
extent for which order will be preserved by the Service.

     • If access_scope is set to INSTANCE (the lowest level), then
       changes to each instance are considered unordered relative
       to changes to any other instance. That means that changes
       (creations, deletions, modifications) made to two instances are
       not necessarily seen in the order they occur. This is the case
       even if it is the same application thread making the changes
       using the same DataWriter.

     • If access_scope is set to TOPIC, changes (creations, deletions,
       modifications) made by a single DataWriter are made available to
       subscribers in the same order they occur. Changes made to instances
       through different DataWriter entities are not necessarily seen
       in the order they occur. This is the case, even if the changes
       are made by a single application thread using DataWriter objects
       attached to the same Publisher.

     • Finally, if access_scope is set to GROUP, changes made to
       instances via DataWriter entities attached to the same Publisher
       object are made available to subscribers on the same order
       they occur.

Note that this QoS policy controls the scope at which related changes are
made available to the subscriber. This means the subscriber can access
the changes in a coherent manner and in the proper order; however,
it does not necessarily imply that the Subscriber will indeed access
the changes in the correct order. For that to occur, the application at
the subscriber end must use the proper logic in reading the DataReader
objects, as described in “Access to the data.”

The value offered is considered compatible with the value requested if
and only if the following conditions are met:

    1. The inequality “offered access_scope >= requested access_scope”
       evaluates to ‘TRUE.’ For the purposes of this inequality,
       the values of PRESENTATION access_scope are considered ordered
       such that INSTANCE < TOPIC < GROUP.

    2. Requested coherent_access is FALSE, or else both offered and
       requested coherent_access are TRUE.

    3. Requested ordered_access is FALSE, or else both offered and
       requested ordered _access are TRUE.
