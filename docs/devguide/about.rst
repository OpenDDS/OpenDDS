This Developer's Guide corresponds to OpenDDS version |release|.
This guide is primarily focused on the specifics of using and configuring OpenDDS to build distributed publish-subscribe applications.
While it does give a general overview of the OMG Data Distribution Service, this guide is not intended to provide comprehensive coverage of the specification.
The intent of this guide is to help you become proficient with OpenDDS as quickly as possible.
Readers are encouraged to submit corrections to this guide using a GitHub pull request.

Examples

    Sect<0.5>

The examples in this guide are intended for the learning of the reader and should not be considered to be "production-ready" code.
In particular, error handling is sometimes kept to a minimum to help the reader focus on the particular feature or technique that is being presented in the example.
The source code for all these examples is available as part of the OpenDDS source code distribution in the :ghfile:`DevGuideExamples` directory.
MPC files are provided with the examples for generating build-tool specific files, such as GNU Makefiles or Visual C++ project and solution files.
To run an example, execute the ``run_test.pl`` Perl script.
