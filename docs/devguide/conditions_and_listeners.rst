Introduction

    Sect<4.1>

The DDS specification defines two separate mechanisms for notifying applications of DCPS communication status changes.
Most of the status types define a structure that contains information related to the change of status and can be detected by the application using conditions or listeners.
The different status types are described in  :ref:`conditions_and_listeners--communication-status-types`.

Each entity type (domain participant, topic, publisher, subscriber, data reader, and data writer) defines its own corresponding listener interface.
Applications can implement this interface and then attach their listener implementation to the entity.
Each listener interface contains an operation for each status that can be reported for that entity.
The listener is asynchronously called back with the appropriate operation whenever a qualifying status change occurs.
Details of the different listener types are discussed in :ref:`conditions_and_listeners--listeners`.

Conditions are used in conjunction with Wait Sets to let applications synchronously wait on events.
The basic usage pattern for conditions involves creating the condition objects, attaching them to a wait set, and then waiting on the wait set until one of the conditions is triggered.
The result of wait tells the application which conditions were triggered, allowing the application to take the appropriate actions to get the corresponding status information.
Conditions are described in greater detail in :ref:`conditions_and_listeners--conditions`.

**************************
Communication Status Types
**************************

..
    Sect<4.2>

Each status type is associated with a particular entity type.
This section is organized by the entity types, with the corresponding statuses described in subsections under the associated entity type.

Most of the statuses below are plain communication statuses.
The exceptions are ``DATA_ON_READERS`` and ``DATA_AVAILABLE`` which are read statuses.
Plain communication statuses define an IDL data structure.
Their corresponding section below describes this structure and its fields.
The read statuses are simple notifications to the application which then reads or takes the samples as desired.

Incremental values in the status data structure report a change since the last time the status was accessed.
A status is considered accessed when a listener is called for that status or the status is read from its entity.

Fields in the status data structure with a type of ``InstanceHandle_t`` identify an entity (topic, data reader, data writer, etc.)
by the instance handle used for that entity in the Built-In-Topics.

.. _conditions_and_listeners--topic-status-types:

.. code-block:: omg-idl

    struct InconsistentTopicStatus {
      long total_count;
      long total_count_change;

.. _conditions_and_listeners--listeners:

*********
Listeners
*********

..
    Sect<4.3>

Each entity defines its own listener interface based on the statuses it can report.
Any entity’s listener interface also inherits from the listeners of its owned entities, allowing it to handle statuses for owned entities as well.
For example, a subscriber listener directly defines an operation to handle Data On Readers statuses and inherits from the data reader listener as well.

Each status operation takes the general form of ``on_<status_name>(<entity>, <status_struct>)``, where ``<status_name>`` is the name of the status being reported, ``<entity>`` is a reference to the entity the status is reported for, and ``<status_struct>`` is the structure with details of the status.
Read statuses omit the second parameter.
For example, here is the operation for the Sample Lost status:

::

      void on_sample_lost(in DataReader the_reader, in SampleLostStatus status);

Listeners can either be passed to the factory function used to create their entity or explicitly set by calling ``set_listener()`` on the entity after it is created.
Both of these functions also take a status mask as a parameter.
The mask indicates which statuses are enabled in that listener.
Mask bit values for each status are defined in DdsDcpsInfrastructure.idl:

.. code-block:: omg-idl

    module DDS {
      typedef unsigned long StatusKind;
      typedef unsigned long StatusMask; // bit-mask StatusKind

      const StatusKind INCONSISTENT_TOPIC_STATUS        = 0x0001 << 0;
      const StatusKind OFFERED_DEADLINE_MISSED_STATUS   = 0x0001 << 1;
      const StatusKind REQUESTED_DEADLINE_MISSED_STATUS = 0x0001 << 2;
      const StatusKind OFFERED_INCOMPATIBLE_QOS_STATUS  = 0x0001 << 5;
      const StatusKind REQUESTED_INCOMPATIBLE_QOS_STATUS= 0x0001 << 6;
      const StatusKind SAMPLE_LOST_STATUS               = 0x0001 << 7;
      const StatusKind SAMPLE_REJECTED_STATUS           = 0x0001 << 8;
      const StatusKind DATA_ON_READERS_STATUS           = 0x0001 << 9;
      const StatusKind DATA_AVAILABLE_STATUS            = 0x0001 << 10;
      const StatusKind LIVELINESS_LOST_STATUS           = 0x0001 << 11;
      const StatusKind LIVELINESS_CHANGED_STATUS        = 0x0001 << 12;
      const StatusKind PUBLICATION_MATCHED_STATUS       = 0x0001 << 13;
      const StatusKind SUBSCRIPTION_MATCHED_STATUS      = 0x0001 << 14;
    };

Simply do a bit-wise “or” of the desired status bits to construct a mask for your listener.
Here is an example of attaching a listener to a data reader (for just Data Available statuses):

.. code-block:: cpp

        DDS::DataReaderListener_var listener (new DataReaderListenerImpl);
        // Create the Datareader
        DDS::DataReader_var dr = sub->create_datareader(
          topic,
          DATAREADER_QOS_DEFAULT,
          listener,
          DDS::DATA_AVAILABLE_STATUS);

Here is an example showing how to change the listener using ``set_listener()``:

.. code-block:: cpp

      dr->set_listener(listener,
      DDS::DATA_AVAILABLE_STATUS |       DDS::LIVELINESS_CHANGED_STATUS);

When a plain communication status changes, OpenDDS invokes the most specific relevant listener operation.
This means, for example, that a data reader’s listener would take precedence over the subscriber’s listener for statuses related to the data reader.

A common “gotcha” when using ``set_listener`` is that the listener is not invoked immediately.
Instead, the listener will be invoked for the next status change.
Consequently, usages of ``set_listener`` should 1) invoke the listener manually after calling ``set_listener`` and 2) ensure that the listener methods are thread safe.

The following sections define the different listener interfaces.
For more details on the individual statuses, see :ref:`conditions_and_listeners--communication-status-types`.

    };

.. _conditions_and_listeners--conditions:

**********
Conditions
**********

..
    Sect<4.4>

The DDS specification defines four types of condition:

* Status Condition

* Read Condition

* Query Condition

* Guard Condition

.. _conditions_and_listeners--status-condition:

Status Condition
================

..
    Sect<4.4.1>

Each entity has a status condition object associated with it and a ``get_statuscondition()`` operation that lets applications access the status condition.
Each condition has a set of enabled statuses that can trigger that condition.
Attaching one or more conditions to a wait set allows application developers to wait on the condition’s status set.
Once an enabled status is triggered, the wait call returns from the wait set and the developer can query the relevant status condition on the entity.
Querying the status condition resets the status.

.. _conditions_and_listeners--status-condition-example:

Status Condition Example
------------------------

..
    Sect<4.4.1.1>

This example enables the Offered Incompatible QoS status on a data writer, waits for it, and then queries it when it triggers.
The first step is to get the status condition from the data writer, enable the desired status, and attach it to a wait set:

.. code-block:: cpp

      DDS::StatusCondition_var cond = data_writer->get_statuscondition();
      cond->set_enabled_statuses(DDS::OFFERED_INCOMPATIBLE_QOS_STATUS);

      DDS::WaitSet_var ws = new DDS::WaitSet;
      ws->attach_condition(cond);

Now we can wait ten seconds for the condition:

.. code-block:: cpp

      DDS::ConditionSeq active;
      DDS::Duration_t ten_seconds = {10, 0};
      int result = ws->wait(active, ten_seconds);

The result of this operation is either a timeout or a set of triggered conditions in the active sequence:

.. code-block:: cpp

      if (result == DDS::RETCODE_TIMEOUT) {
        cout << "Wait timed out" << std::endl;
      } else if (result == DDS::RETCODE_OK) {
        DDS::OfferedIncompatibleQosStatus incompatibleStatus;
        data_writer->get_offered_incompatible_qos(incompatibleStatus);
        // Access status fields as desired...
      }

Developers have the option of attaching multiple conditions to a single wait set as well as enabling multiple statuses per condition.

.. _conditions_and_listeners--additional-condition-types:

Additional Condition Types
==========================

..
    Sect<4.4.2>

The DDS specification also defines three other types of conditions: read conditions, query conditions, and guard conditions.
These conditions do not directly involve the processing of statuses but allow the integration of other activities into the condition and wait set mechanisms.
These are other conditions are briefly described here.
For more information see the DDS specification or the OpenDDS tests in :ghfile:`tests/`.

.. _conditions_and_listeners--read-conditions:

Read Conditions
---------------

..
    Sect<4.4.2.1>

Read conditions are created using the data reader and the same masks that are passed to the read and take operations.
When waiting on this condition, it is triggered whenever samples match the specified masks.
Those samples can then be retrieved using the ``read_w_condition()`` and ``take_w_condition()`` operations which take the read condition as a parameter.

.. _conditions_and_listeners--query-conditions:

Query Conditions
----------------

..
    Sect<4.4.2.2>

Query conditions are a specialized form of read conditions that are created with a limited form of an SQL-like query.
This allows applications to filter the data samples that trigger the condition and then are read use the normal read condition mechanisms.
See Section :ref:`content_subscription_profile--query-condition` for more information about query conditions.

.. _conditions_and_listeners--guard-conditions:

Guard Conditions
----------------

..
    Sect<4.4.2.3>

The guard condition is a simple interface that allows the application to create its own condition object and trigger it when application events (external to OpenDDS) occur.
