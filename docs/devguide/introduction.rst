.. _spec-idl-to-java:

IDL to Java Language Mapping
=============================

This specification defines an :term:`IDL` to Java mapping and is used for the :ref:`java`.

The version OpenDDS uses is :omgspec:`java`.

..
    Sect<1.2>

.. _introduction--compliance:

**********
Compliance
**********

..
    Sect<1.2.1>

OpenDDS complies with the OMG DDS and the OMG DDSI-RTPS specifications.
Details of that compliance follows here.
OpenDDS also implements the OMG DDS Security specification.
See :ref:`specs` for how OpenDDS complies with other specifications it implements.

.. _introduction--dds-compliance:

DDS Compliance
==============

..
    Sect<1.2.1.1>

Section 2 of the DDS specification defines five compliance points for a DDS implementation:

* Minimum Profile

* Content-Subscription Profile

* Persistence Profile

* Ownership Profile

* Object Model Profile

OpenDDS complies with the entire DDS specification (including all optional profiles).
This includes the implementation of all Quality of Service policies with the following notes:

* :ref:`qos-reliability` ``RELIABLE_RELIABILITY_QOS`` is supported by the :ref:`rtps-udp-transport`, the :ref:`tcp-transport`, and the :ref:`multicast-transport` (when configured as reliable).

* :ref:`qos-transport-priority` is not implemented as changeable.

Although version 1.5 of the DDS specification is not yet published, OpenDDS incorporates some changes planned for that version that are required for a robust implementation:

* :omgissue:`DDS15-5`: The IDL type ``BuiltinTopicKey_t`` is a struct containing an array of 16 octets

  * The actual child issue isn't public viewable for some reason, but the member link is https://issues.omg.org/browse/DDS15-257

.. _introduction--ddsi-rtps-compliance:

DDSI-RTPS Compliance
====================

..
    Sect<1.2.1.2>

The OpenDDS implementation complies with the requirements of the OMG DDSI-RTPS specification.

.. _introduction--opendds-rtps-implementation-notes:

OpenDDS RTPS Implementation Notes
---------------------------------

..
    Sect<1.2.1.2.1>

The :ref:`OMG DDSI-RTPS specification <spec-rtps>` supplies statements for implementation, but not required for compliance.
The following items should be taken into consideration when utilizing the OpenDDS RTPS functionality for transport and/or discovery.
Section numbers of the DDSI-RTPS specification are supplied with each item for further reference.

Items not implemented in OpenDDS:

#. Writer-side content filtering (:omgspec:`rtps:8.7.3 Content-filtered Topics`)

   OpenDDS may still drop samples that aren't needed (due to content filtering) by any associated readers -- this is done above the transport layer

#. :omgspec:`rtps:8.7.6 Coherent Sets` for :ref:`qos-presentation`

#. :omgspec:`rtps:8.7.7 Directed Write`

   OpenDDS will use the Directed Write parameter if it's present on incoming messages (for example, messages generated by a different DDS implementation)

#. :omgspec:`rtps:8.7.8 Property Lists`

#. :omgspec:`rtps:8.7.9 Original Writer Info` for :ref:`qos-durability`

   This would only be used for transient and persistent durability, which are :omgspec:`not supported by the RTPS specification <rtps:8.7.2.2.1>`

#. :omgspec:`Key Hashes <rtps:8.7.10 Key Hash>` are not generated, but the specification makes them optional

#. ``nackSuppressionDuration`` (Table 8.47 in :omgspec:`rtps:8.4.7.1 RTPS Writer`) and ``heartbeatSuppressionDuration`` (Table 8.62 in :omgspec:`rtps:8.4.10.1 RTPS Reader`).

.. note:: Items 3 and 4 above are described in the DDSI-RTPS specification.
  However, they do not have a corresponding concept in the DDS specification.

.. _introduction--idl-compliance:

IDL Compliance
==============

..
    Sect<1.2.1.3>

OMG IDL is used in a few different ways in the OpenDDS code base and downstream applications that use it:

* Files that come with OpenDDS such as :ghfile:`dds/DdsDcpsTopic.idl` define parts of the API between the middleware libraries and the application.
  This is known as the OMG IDL Platform Specific Model (PSM).

* Users of OpenDDS author IDL files in addition to source code files in C++ or Java.

This section only describes the latter use.

The IDL specification (version 4.2) uses the term "building block" to define subsets of the overall IDL grammar that may be supported by certain tools.
OpenDDS supports the following building blocks, with notes/caveats listed below each:

* Core Data Types

  * Support for the "fixed" data type (fixed point decimal) is incomplete.

* Anonymous Types

  * There is limited support for anonymous types when they appear as sequence/array instantiations directly as struct field types.
    Using an explicitly-named type is recommended.

* Annotations

  * See :ref:`getting_started--defining-data-types-with-idl` and :ref:`xtypes--idl-annotations` for details on which built-in annotations are supported.

  * User-defined annotation types are also supported.

* Extended Data Types

  * The integer types ``int8``, ``uint8``, ``int16``, ``uin16``, ``int32`` ``uint32``, ``int64``, and ``uint64`` are supported.

  * The rest of the building block is not supported.

.. _introduction--extensions-to-the-dds-specification:

***********************************
Extensions to the DDS Specification
***********************************

..
    Sect<1.2.2>

Data types, interfaces, and constants in the ``DDS`` IDL module (C++ namespace, Java package) correspond directly to the DDS specification with very few exceptions:

* ``DDS::SampleInfo`` contains an extra field starting with ``opendds_reserved``.

* Type-specific DataReaders (including those for Built-in Topics) have additional operations ``read_instance_w_condition()`` and ``take_instance_w_condition()``.

Additional extended behavior is provided by various classes and interfaces in the ``OpenDDS`` module/namespace/package.
Those include features like Recorder and Replayer (:ref:`altdata`) and also:

* ``OpenDDS::DCPS::TypeSupport`` adds the ``unregister_type()`` operation not found in the DDS spec.

* ``OpenDDS::DCPS::ALL_STATUS_MASK``, ``NO_STATUS_MASK``, and ``DEFAULT_STATUS_MASK`` are useful constants for the ``DDS::StatusMask`` type used by ``DDS::Entity``, ``DDS::StatusCondition``, and the various ``create_*()`` operations.

.. _introduction--opendds-architecture:

***************************************
OpenDDS Implementation and Architecture
***************************************

..
    Sect<1.2.3>

This section gives a brief overview of the OpenDDS implementation, its features, and some of its components.

Source Code Organization
========================

Relative to :envvar:`DDS_ROOT`:

* the :ghfile:`dds/` directory contains the source code for OpenDDS.
* the :ghfile:`tests/` directory contains tests.
* the :ghfile:`tools/` directory contains tools and libraries like the DCPSInfoRepo, RtpsRelay, and the Modeling SDK.
* the :ghfile:`DevGuideExamples/` directory contains examples used in this guide.
* the :ghfile:`examples/` directory contains examples *not* used in this guide.
* the :ghfile:`docs/` directory contains documentation for users and developers of OpenDDS.

.. _introduction--design-philosophy:

Design Philosophy
=================

..
    Sect<1.2.3.1>

The OpenDDS implementation and API is based on a fairly strict interpretation of the OMG IDL PSM.
In almost all cases the OMG's IDL-to-C++ Language Mapping is used to define how the IDL in the DDS specification is mapped into the C++ APIs that OpenDDS exposes to the client.

The main deviation from the OMG IDL PSM is that local interfaces are used for the entities and various other interfaces.
These are defined as unconstrained (non-local) interfaces in the DDS specification.
Defining them as local interfaces improves performance, reduces memory usage, simplifies the client's interaction with these interfaces, and makes it easier for clients to build their own implementations.

.. _plugins:

Plugins
=======

OpenDDS puts many implementation details into libraries that are outside the core ``OpenDDS_Dcps`` library.
Making these features modular allows users to build and distribute their applications without building or distributing code their applications won't use.
It also makes it easier to replace these libraries with custom ones.

- :ref:`transports <transports>`:

  - :ref:`tcp-transport`
  - :ref:`rtps-udp-transport`
  - :ref:`udp-transport`
  - :ref:`multicast-transport`
  - :ref:`shmem-transport`

- :ref:`discovery <discovery>` [#plugins-static-disc]_:

  - :ref:`inforepo-disc`
  - :ref:`rtps-disc`

- :ref:`security <sec>` [#plugins-sec]_

How to enable and use a particular plugin will differ based on the kind of plugin and the plugin itself, but generally they are enabled by some form of configuration setting, for example using :cfg:prop:`[transport]transport_type` or :cfg:prop:`DCPSSecurity` in a configuration file.
The plugin will also have to be linked and initialized at runtime.
For dynamic libraries (``.dll``, ``.dynlib`` or, ``.so`` files) this is done automatically as the OpenDDS will load the dynamic library and then run any initialization the plugin requires.
When the plugins are statically linked, then it requires explicit linking and including an initialization header in the application that contains a global object that will initialize the plugin.
If OpenDDS was :ref:`built using CMake <cmake-building>`, then :ghfile:`dds/DCPS/StaticIncludes.h` can be included and the initialization headers will be included automatically based on the :ref:`static libraries <cmake-libraries>` that were linked.
Explicit linking and initialization headers can also be used with dynamic libraries.
This will always load and initialize the plugin when the application starts instead of delaying until the plugin is needed.

.. _transports:

Transports
==========

..
    Sect<1.2.3.2>

Transmission of :term:`samples <Sample>` and information related to their management is accomplished via an OpenDDS-specific transport framework that allows the service to be used with a variety of transport protocols.
Transports are typically specified via configuration files and are attached to various entities in the publisher and subscriber processes.
See :ref:`config-transport` for details on configuring transports generally.

  ==============#==============================#==============

Transports are used along with :ref:`discovery <discovery>` to define how OpenDDS communicates.

.. _tcp-transport:

TCP Transport
-------------

The TCP transport (``tcp``) uses `TCP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol>`__ as the transmission mechanism.
It's the default transport normally.
It's :ref:`reliable <qos-reliability>`, regardless of configuration.

  :cfg:prop:`[transport]transport_type`: :cfg:val:`tcp <[transport]transport_type=tcp>`

  Configuration: :ref:`tcp-transport-config`

.. _rtps-udp-transport:

RTPS/UDP Transport
------------------

The RTPS/UDP transport (``rtps_udp``) uses the UDP-based transport described in :ref:`spec-rtps` as the transmission mechanism.
It's interoperable with other DDS implementations when used with :ref:`rtps-disc`.
It's the default transport when :doc:`safety_profile` is being used.
It supports :ref:`reliability <qos-reliability>`.

.. important::

  :doc:`internet_enabled_rtps`
    For using :ref:`rtps-disc` and the :ref:`rtps-udp-transport` over the internet

.. _udp-transport:

UDP Transport
-------------

The UDP transport (``udp``) uses `unicasted <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicast>`__ `UDP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol>`__ as the transmission mechanism.
It doesn't support :ref:`reliability <qos-reliability>` at all.

.. important::

  Configuration: :ref:`udp-transport-config`

.. _multicast-transport:

Multicast Transport
-------------------

The multicast transport (``mutlicast``) uses `multicasted <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast>`__ `UDP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol>`__ as the transmission mechanism.
It supports :ref:`reliability <qos-reliability>`.

.. important::

  Configuration: :ref:`multicast-transport-config`

.. _shmem-transport:

Shared Memory Transport
-----------------------

.. note::

  This transport is not currently supported on macOS because `macOS lacks support for POSIX unnamed semaphores <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27736618>`__.

The shared memory transport (``shmem``) uses `shared memory <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_memory>`__ on the local host as the transmission mechanism.
It's :ref:`reliable <qos-reliability>`, regardless of configuration.

.. important::

  Library filename: ``OpenDDS_Shmem``

  MPC base project name: :ghfile:`\`\`dcps_shmem\`\` <MPC/config/dcps_shmem.mpb>`

  CMake target Name: :cmake:tgt:`OpenDDS::Shmem`

  :cfg:prop:`[transport]transport_type`: :cfg:val:`shmem <[transport]transport_type=shmem>`

  Configuration: :ref:`shmem-transport-config`

.. _introduction--custom-transports:

Custom Transports
-----------------

The transport framework enables application developers to implement their own customized transports.
Implementing a custom transport involves specializing a number of classes defined in the transport framework.
The ``udp`` transport provides a good foundation developers may use when creating their own implementation.
See the :ghfile:`dds/DCPS/transport/udp/` directory for details.

.. _discovery:

Discovery
=========

..
    Sect<1.2.3.3>

DDS applications must :ref:`discover <dds-introduction--discovery>` one another via some central agent or through some distributed scheme.
OpenDDS provides three options for discovery: :ref:`inforepo-disc`, :ref:`rtps-disc`, and :ref:`static-disc`.
The choice of discovery is independent of the choice of transport in most cases.
For example, one can use the :ref:`tcp-transport` with :ref:`rtps-disc`.
Notable exceptions are:

#. :doc:`dds_security` requires using both :ref:`rtps-disc` and the :ref:`rtps-udp-transport`.
#. To get the most out of :doc:`xtypes`, it's recommended to both :ref:`rtps-disc` and the :ref:`rtps-udp-transport`
#. :ref:`static-disc` requires :ref:`rtps-udp-transport`.

Like transports, additional discovery implementations can be created and plugged in.

.. _introduction--centralized-discovery-with-dcpsinforepo:
.. _inforepo-disc:

InfoRepo Discovery
------------------

..
    Sect<1.2.3.3.1>

.. note::

  InfoRepo discovery is scheduled for deprecation with OpenDDS 4 and scheduled for removal with OpenDDS 5.

OpenDDS contains a standalone CORBA service called :ref:`inforepo`.
An instance of the DCPSInfoRepo is shared by all the participants in a domain and constitutes a centralized approach to discovery.
Each OpenDDS application connects to the DCPSInfoRepo and creates records for its participants, topics, data writers, and data readers.
As records for data writers and data readers are created, they are matched against the existing set of records.
When matches are found, the DCPSInfoRepo invokes the participant to perform the necessary associations.

  :ref:`Initialization header <plugins>`: :ghfile:`dds/DCPS/InfoRepoDiscovery/InfoRepoDiscovery.h`

  Configuration: :ref:`inforepo-disc-config`

The DCPSInfoRepo is not involved in data propagation; its role is limited in scope to OpenDDS applications discovering one another.
The DCPSInfoRepo populates the :ref:`introduction--built-in-topics` for a participant if configured to do so.
OpenDDS creates its own ORB and a separate thread to run that ORB when using DCPSInfoRepo discovery.

Application developers are free to run multiple information repositories with each managing their own non-overlapping sets of DCPS domains.

It is also possible to operate domains with more than a single repository, thus forming a distributed virtual repository.
This is known as *Repository Federation*.
In order for individual repositories to participate in a federation, each one must specify its own federation identifier value (a 32-bit numeric value) upon start-up.
See :ref:`the_dcps_information_repository--repository-federation` for further information about repository federations.

RTPS Discovery
--------------

..
    Sect<1.2.3.3.2>

RTPS discovery is a peer-to-peer discovery mechanism standardized as part of the :omgspec:`RTPS spec <rtps:8.5 Discovery Module>`.
Other DDS implementations can interoperate with OpenDDS when RTPS discovery is used with the :ref:`rtps-udp-transport`.

  Library filename: ``OpenDDS_Rtps``

  MPC base project name: :ghfile:`\`\`dcps_rtps\`\` <MPC/config/dcps_rtps.mpb>`

  CMake target Name: :cmake:tgt:`OpenDDS::Rtps`

  :ref:`Initialization header <plugins>`: :ghfile:`dds/DCPS/RTPS/RtpsDiscovery.h`

  Configuration: :ref:`rtps-disc-config`

RTPS Discovery uses the RTPS protocol to advertise and discover participants, data writers, and data readers.
RTPS Discovery uses multicast to discover participants and *built-in endpoints* (not to be confused with :term:`built-in topics`) each other without a centralized broker such as InfoRepo.
This part of RTPS discovery is called the Simple Participant Discovery Protocol (SPDP).
After the built-in endpoints are discovered and associated, they exchange information about data writers and data readers which are called *endpoints*.
This part of RTPS discovery is called Simple Endpoint Discovery Protocol (SEDP).
RTPS Discovery is a peer-to-peer approach to discovery as each participant interacts directly with other participants to accomplish discovery.

The following are additional implementation limits that developers need to take into consideration when developing and deploying applications that use RTPS discovery:

#. Domain IDs should be between 0 and 231 (inclusive) due to the way UDP ports are assigned to domain IDs.
   In each OpenDDS process, up to 120 domain participants are supported in each domain.

#. Topic names and type identifiers are limited to 256 characters.

#. The :ref:`multicast-transport` does not work with RTPS Discovery due to the way GUIDs are assigned (a warning will be issued if this is attempted).

Static Discovery
----------------

In Static Discovery, each participant starts with a database containing identifiers, QoS settings, and network locators for all participants, topics, data writers, data readers.

  The :ref:`rtps-udp-transport` is the only transport that can be used with Static Discovery.

  Static Discovery is built-in to the core Dcps library, so it doesn't require linking a separate library or including an initialization header.

  Configuration: :ref:`static-disc-config`

When an application creates a data writer or data reader, Static Discovery causes it to send out periodic announcements.
Upon receiving one of these announcements, Static Discovery consults its local database of entities to look up the details necessary for matching and matches it against local entities.

Static Discovery requires that the :ref:`qos-user-data` be configured for each participant, data writer, and data reader.
This user data must contain the identifier of the entity that is being created.
Thus, the user data QoS is not available for general use when using Static Discovery.
Static Discovery also requires that the network locators for all entities be determined up front by configuring the transport with the necessary networking information.

.. _introduction--threading:

Threading
=========

..
    Sect<1.2.3.4>

OpenDDS creates its own threads for handling I/O, timers, asynchronous jobs, and cleanup tasks.
These threads are collectively called *service threads*.
Applications may receive a callback from these threads via :ref:`conditions_and_listeners--listeners`.

When publishing a sample, OpenDDS normally attempts to send the sample to any connected subscribers using the calling thread.
If the send call would block, then the sample may be queued for sending on a separate service thread.
This behavior depends on the QoS policies described in :ref:`qos`.

All incoming data is read by a service thread and queued for reading in DataReaders by the application.
If a DataReader has a listener that should be invoked when data is available, then the listener is invoked by the service thread.

.. _introduction--configuration:

Configuration
=============

..
    Sect<1.2.3.5>

OpenDDS includes a file-based configuration framework for configuring both global items such as debug level, memory allocation, and discovery, as well as transport implementation details for publishers and subscribers.
Configuration can also be achieved directly in code, however, it is recommended that configuration be externalized for ease of maintenance and reduction in runtime errors.
The complete set of configuration options are described in :ref:`config`.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#plugins-static-disc] :ref:`static-disc` is built-in to the core Dcps library, so it doesn't require linking a separate library or including an initialization header.

.. [#plugins-sec] Within DDS Security there is :ref:`a concept of plugins <dds_security--architecture-of-the-dds-security-specification>` that is mostly separate from the plugins described here.
    They are for implementing specific security features such as different encryption methods.
    The built-in security library is a default implementation of these, but a custom OpenDDS security plugin could implement one or more of these DDS Security plugins.
