What is OpenDDS?
****************

..
    Sect<0.1>

OpenDDS is an open source implementation of a group of related Object Management Group (OMG) specifications.

#. **Data Distribution Service (DDS) for Real-Time Systems v1.4** (OMG document formal/2015-04-10).
   This specification details the core functionality implemented by OpenDDS for real-time publish and subscribe applications and is described throughout this document.

#. **The Real-time Publish-Subscribe Wire Protocol DDS Interoperability Wire Protocol Specification (DDSI-RTPS) v2.3** (OMG document formal/2019-04-03).
   Although the document number is v2.3, it specifies protocol version 2.4.
   This specification describes the requirements for interoperability between DDS implementations.

#. **DDS Security v1.1** (OMG document formal/2018-04-01) extends DDS with capabilities for authentication and encryption.
   OpenDDS’s support for the DDS Security specification is described below in Chapter :ref:`dds_security--dds-security`.

#. **Extensible and Dynamic Topic Types for DDS (XTypes) v1.3** (OMG document formal/2020-02-04) defines details of the type system used for the data exchanged on DDS Topics, including how schema and data are encoded for network transmission.
   etails of DDS-XTypes are below in Chapter :ref:`xtypes--xtypes`.

OpenDDS is sponsored by Object Computing, Inc. (OCI) and is available via `https://www.opendds.org <https://www.opendds.org/>`__.

About This Guide
****************

..
    Sect<0.3>

This Developer’s Guide corresponds to OpenDDS version 3.23.
This guide is primarily focused on the specifics of using and configuring OpenDDS to build distributed publish-subscribe applications.
While it does give a general overview of the OMG Data Distribution Service, this guide is not intended to provide comprehensive coverage of the specification.
The intent of this guide is to help you become proficient with OpenDDS as quickly as possible.

.. _preface--coding-examples:

***************
Coding Examples
***************

..
    Sect<0.5>

Throughout this guide, we illustrate topics with coding examples.
The examples in this guide are intended for illustration purposes and should not be considered to be “production-ready” code.
In particular, error handling is sometimes kept to a minimum to help the reader focus on the particular feature or technique that is being presented in the example.
The source code for all these examples is available as part of the OpenDDS source code distribution in the :ghfile:`DevGuideExamples` directory.
MPC files are provided with the examples for generating build-tool specific files, such as GNU Makefiles or Visual C++ project and solution files.
A Perl script named ``run_test.pl`` is provided with each example so you can easily run it.

.. _preface--related-documents:

*****************
Related Documents
*****************

..
    Sect<0.6>

Throughout this guide, we refer to various specifications published by the Object Management Group (OMG) and from other sources.

OMG references take the form *group/number* where *group* represents the OMG working group responsible for developing the specification, or the keyword ``formal`` if the specification has been formally adopted, and *number* represents the year, month, and serial number within the month the specification was released.
For example, the OMG DDS version 1.4 specification is referenced as ``formal/2015-04-10``.

You can download any referenced OMG specification directly from the OMG web site by prepending ``http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?`` to the specification’s reference.
Thus, the specification ``formal/07-01-01`` becomes http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/07-01-01.
Providing this destination to a web browser should take you to a site from which you can download the referenced specification document.

Additional documentation on OpenDDS is produced and maintained by Object Computing, Inc. and is available from the OpenDDS Website at  `https://www.opendds.org <https://www.opendds.org/>`__.
