- :ref:`qos`

  - Added :ref:`qos-property`, :ref:`qos-data-representation`, and :ref:`qos-type-consistency-enforcement`.
  - Every policy now has a box that says if it's mutable, if it affects writer-reader association, and a link to the spec definition.
    Also removed large default value tables and put the default values in these boxes.
  - Added links to the QoS policies.

- Added definitions for :term:`instance`, :term:`unregister`, and :term:`dispose` to the glossary.

.. news-start-section: :ref:`sec`
- Moved :ref:`fnmatch-exprs` into an "annex" file so it can be common between security and partitions QoS.
