- :cmake:func:`opendds_target_sources`

  - Added support for using the same IDL files in different targets with different options.
  - It will not automatically generate an export header when all IDL files are scoped ``PRIVATE`` unless :cmake:func:`opendds_target_sources(ALWAYS_GENERATE_LIB_EXPORT_HEADER)` is set to ``TRUE``.
  - It will not export symbols in code generated from ``PRIVATE`` IDL files.
  - Added support for the `codegen <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/policy/CMP0171.html>`__ target (CMake 3.31 or later) to build and run IDL compilers on targets with IDL.
