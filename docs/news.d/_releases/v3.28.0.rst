Additions
=========

- Added an XCDR2 value writer that can be used to serialize static and dynamic samples to XCDR2 encoding format. (:ghpr:`4421`)
- Added utility to :ref:`flatten the index <xtypes--reading-collections-of-basic-types>` to a multi-dimensional array represented by dynamic data. (:ghpr:`4421`)
- A new header, ``dds/OpenDDSConfig.h`` is generated by configure or CMake. (:ghpr:`4482`, :ghpr:`4498`)

  - Users manually configuring a build will need to create this file, which may be empty, or add ``#define OPENDDS_IGNORE_OPENDDSCONFIG_H_FILE`` to their ``ace/config.h`` file.
  - See :ghfile:`dds/OpenDDSConfig.h.in` for details.

- ``ConfigStore``

  - Converted the transport and discovery loading and ``domain`` section to use ``ConfigStore``. (:ghpr:`4488`, :ghpr:`4475`, :ghpr:`4469`, :ghpr:`4454`)
  - OpenDDS can now be configured with environment variables. (:ghpr:`4491`)

    - See :ref:`config-environment-variables` for details.

  - OpenDDS now supports multiple config files. (:ghpr:`4505`)

    - See :ref:`config-store-keys` for details.

  - The ConfigStore is available in Java. (:ghpr:`4515`)

- The ``@value(x)`` annotation is now supported on IDL enumerators when using the IDL-to-C++11 mapping. (:ghpr:`4519`)

  - See :ref:`xtypes--anno-value` for details.

- The IDL for the Shapes example was updated for interoperability. (:ghpr:`4528`)
- Added :cfg:prop:`[rtps_discovery]SpdpUserTag`. (:ghpr:`4533`)
- The data type for the OpenDDS-specific Built-in ParticipantLocation Topic now includes the lease duration. (:ghpr:`4545`)

  - See :ref:`built_in_topics--openddsparticipantlocation-topic` for details.

- Allow compile-time configuration of CLOCK_BOOTTIME as the clock used for timers (:ghpr:`4568`)

  - If the platform supports it, this can be done using ``--boottime`` when building with the configure script or :cmake:var:`OPENDDS_BOOTTIME_TIMERS` when building with CMake.

Platform Support and Dependencies
=================================

- Building with CMake

  - Fixed :ghissue:`building with CMake and Apple Clang on macOS <4478>` without setting ``-DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=14`` or using ACE 6. (:ghpr:`4481`, :ghpr:`4487`)
  - Added support for C++03 and some support for building ACE/TAO with the same compiler and C++ standard as OpenDDS. (:ghpr:`4481`, :ghpr:`4487`)
  - Fixed :ghissue:`building release builds on Windows at the same time as ACE/TAO <4531>` (:ghpr:`4535`)
  - Fixed :ghissue:`ACE/TAO build not getting Xerces path <4375>` when using :cmake:var:`OPENDDS_XERCES3`. (:ghpr:`4572`)

Fixes
=====

- The ValueReader and ValueWriter interfaces now use ``ACE_CDR::Fixed`` as the type of IDL fixed values (:ghpr:`4466`)

- CMake Config Package

  - Made :cmake:func:`opendds_target_sources(INCLUDE_BASE)` work correctly in more cases, specifically involving generating an export header. (:ghpr:`4489`)

    - Added :cmake:func:`opendds_target_sources(EXPORT_HEADER_DIR)` and :cmake:func:`opendds_export_header(DIR)` as part of these changes.

- Fixed bug so ConfigStore entries generated by SEDP are cleaned up. (:ghpr:`4540`, :ghpr:`4485`)
- Fixed bug where various RtpsDiscoveryConfig setters didn't set. (:ghpr:`4540`, :ghpr:`4485`)
- Fixed bug where ``vread`` for unions used uninitialized memory. (:ghpr:`4544`)
- Fixed bug where an RTPS Reader gets stuck when heartbeat advances. (:ghpr:`4548`)
- XCDR2 KeyOnly serialization of union that has no key now has a delimiter for appendable and mutable extensibility. (:ghpr:`4554`)

Documentation
=============

- :ref:`config` (:ghpr:`4464`, :ghpr:`4570`, :ghpr:`4467`, :ghpr:`4588`)

  - Restructured configuration properties so they can be linked to directly.
    Also reviewed each property description to correct or add missing context as needed.
- :ref:`introduction` (:ghpr:`4467`)

  - Added :ref:`plugins` to explain generally how discovery, transports, and security libraries must be initialized when statically linking these libraries.
  - Added summaries of important information needed to use the discovery and transport libraries.

- :ref:`qos` (:ghpr:`4520`)

  - Added :ref:`qos-property`, :ref:`qos-data-representation`, and :ref:`qos-type-consistency-enforcement`.
  - Every policy now has a box that says if it's mutable, if it affects writer-reader association, and a link to the spec definition.
    Also removed large default value tables and put the default values in these boxes.
  - Added links to the QoS policies.

- Added definitions for :term:`instance`, :term:`unregister`, and :term:`dispose` to the glossary. (:ghpr:`4520`)

- :ref:`sec`

  - Added summary of important information needed to use the security library. (:ghpr:`4467`)
  - Moved :ref:`fnmatch-exprs` into an "annex" file so it can be common between security and partitions QoS. (:ghpr:`4520`)

- ``ConfigStore``

  - Add :ref:`configuration capabilities <run_time_configuration--configuration-approach>` to DevGuide. (:ghpr:`4556`)
