Security
========

- Fixed a vulnerability in the rtps_udp transport where an acknowledgement sequence number beyond the maximum expected by the writer leads to an assert and incorrect state. (:ghpr:`4155`)

  - Thanks to Seulbae Kim (@squizz617) for discovering this.

Fixes
=====

- Fixed leaked shared memory by the shared memory transport. (:ghpr:`#4171`)

  - For a 100% fix, a new ACE version including https://github.com/DOCGroup/ACE_TAO/pull/2077 must be used.

- Fixed bug introduced by :ghpr:`4120` (:ghpr:`4180`, :ghpr:`4184`)

  - The fix introduced in #4120 causes the TransportClient to silently drop messages when the client's guid is not initialized.
    This causes issues for TransportClients that send messages to the transport before association.
    One such example is a DataWriter with liveliness configured.
    The DataWriter will send liveliness messages to the transport (which will be dropped) and hang waiting for them to be delivered.
  - The solution was set the guid for a TransportClient before calling any method that uses the guid.

Notes
=====

- :ghpr:`4180` required changes in InfoRepoDiscovery's IDL, so InfoRepo compatibility with older versions has been broken.
