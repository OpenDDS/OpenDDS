Additions
=========

Platform Support and Dependencies
=================================

- ACE/TAO

  - Updated ACE 8/TAO 4 from 8.0.1 to `8.0.2 <https://github.com/DOCGroup/ACE_TAO/releases/tag/ACE%2BTAO-8_0_2>`__.

- CMake

  - Fixed an issue :ghissue:`where OpenDDS won't build ACE/TAO with Visual Studio 2015 <4842>`. (:ghpr:`4843`)

Notes
=====

- Releases will now use a :ghissue:`new git tagging and branching strategy <4761>`.

  - Previously releases were tagged as either ``DDS-X.Y`` or ``DDS-X.Y.Z``.
    Release tags from now on will also be tagged as ``vX.Y.Z``.
    Any future OpenDDS 3 releases will be tagged both ways, while OpenDDS 4 releases will only be tagged in the new way.

  - New branches can now be used for following specific release series.
    For example `v3` will always be updated to the latest 3 release and ``v3.31`` will be used for any future 3.31 releases.
