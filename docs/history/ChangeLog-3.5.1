Thu Jul 10 15:01:11 UTC 2014  Peter Oschwald  <oschwaldp@ociweb.com>

        * Merged the branch "DataSampleList_split" which:

          Split the DataSampleList interface into three distinct list
          interfaces denoting and clarifying their functionality and
          responsibilities.  This eliminates the requirement that an
          DataSampleList instance is to only be used in a certain "mode"
          --a list for a data writer, a list for a instance, or a list
          for send state--.

          DataSampleList is replaced by:
            WriterDataSampleList
            InstanceDataSampleList
            SendStateDataSampleList

          struct DataSampleListElement has been replaced by a first
          class object DataSampleElement.  This was done to control
          access to the list pointer elements, which now are only
          modified through the list interfaces.

          When deleting a data writer, wait until all control messages
          sent during unregistering of instances have been accounted before

          Added increasing debug levels prior to returning from main to

          Increased time waiting for subsciber 1 to finish and added

Fri Jun 13 19:02:31 UTC 2014  Peter Oschwald  <oschwaldp@ociweb.com>

          To alleviate deadlock when calling send_delayed_notifications, made possible
          deadlocking calls take a match on the sender's repoId so that only its own
          associated WriteDataContainer lock is acquired while sending the delayed
          notifications.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSet.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSet.inl:

          Modified send_stop(_i) interface to pass sender's repoId for use
          in the TransportSendStrategy when calling send_delayed_notifications
          to pass a match for which delayed notifications to send.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ThreadPerConnectionSendTask.cpp:

          ThreadPerConnectionSendTask still calls send_delayed_notification
          with no matchby passing in GUID_UNKNOWN into the send_stop call
          this should be okay, since only one thread is accessing the sending
          data so no deadlocks will happen

          modified execute to pass GUID_UNKNOWN as a paramerter to send_stop_i
          due to element being null, so no sender repoId is available to pass.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportClient.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:

          When send() calls send_delayed_notifications it now passes in a match
          on the elem being sent's publication id.

        * docs/history/ChangeLog-writerlocks_2:

          Merged the branch "writerlocks_2" For details see the branch-specific
