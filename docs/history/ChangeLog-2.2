        * OpenDDS version 2.2 released.

Mon Aug 16 21:50:02 UTC 2010  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * NEWS:

          Added entry for max_blocking_time default value change.

Mon Aug 16 20:56:09 UTC 2010  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.cpp:

          Corrected the default DataWriterQos reliability max_blocking_time
          to be 100ms to be consistent with spec 1.2.

Mon Aug 16 17:33:37 UTC 2010  Brian Johnson  <johnsonb@ociweb.com>

        * performance-tests/DCPS/InfoRepo_population/run_test.pl:

          If sync.ior existed prior to run_test.pl being run, the
          script would continue on before SyncServer actually created
          its own sync.ior file, now sync.ior is removed prior to
          starting the SyncServer.

          Changed test to send each sample as a new instance
          to prevent test failures do to slow transports on
          Solaris.  (Since there was only a depth of 1 the
          previous sample was being removed, like it should be,
          when a new sample of the same instance came in)

Wed Aug 11 21:04:25 UTC 2010  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/Serializer_wstring/Serializer_wstring.mpc:

          Removed "requires += exceptions" since it is unnecessary and it
          no longer works with DOC group TAO.

        * dds/DCPS/MultiTopicDataReader_T.cpp:

        Fixed bug in the MultiTopicDataReader_T<Sample, TypedDataReader>::join
        method; added a check for DDS::RETCODE_OK to ensure that a sample has
        been taken from the reader's read_instance_generic() before it is
        processed.

Sun Aug  8 16:54:25 UTC 2010  Don Busch  <buschd@ociweb.com>

        * Merged the branch "oci_buschd_monitor_2010Jul22", which
          includes handling of a host:port endpoint for the InfoRepo
          IOR, integraton of the dissector with Wireshark 1.3.x,
          a new default IOR/Endpoint for the monitor, and tests.
          For details see the branch-specific change log at
          docs/history/ChangeLog-oci_buschd_monitor_2010Jul22.

Fri Aug  6 21:14:26 UTC 2010  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/OfferedDeadlineWatchdog.cpp:

          Fixed execute() to call the listener once per missed
          deadline period. Previously it could be called twice
          when the timer is triggered and then a new sample is
          received right after and missed deadline, it could
          cause incorrect status counter.

          - Adjusted the missed deadline status counter.
          - Cleaned and added loggings to make debugging easier.

          DOC group ACE+TAO has removed a few macros that were still in use
          here.  ACE_THROW_SPEC is still used for TAO 1.5a, so we will define
          it to empty if ACE doesn't define it.  This requires #including
          dds/DCPS/Definitions.h.
          Other changes:
          - ACE_{static,const,reinterpret}_cast (replaced with C++ cast)
          - ACE_LIB_TEXT -> ACE_TEXT
          - ACE_PRINT_EXCEPTION(e,s) -> e._tao_print_exception(s)
          - Removed PortableServer::RefCountServantBase
          - Removed lingering excption emulation macros (ACE_ENV_*)

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest2/main.cpp:
        * tools/monitor/Monitor_main.cpp:

          Change to wchar-compliant main function (ACE_TMAIN).

        * tools/dissector/packet.cpp:

          Removed unneeded ACE_INLINE.

        * dds/DCPS/yard/CHANGELOG.txt:
        * java/jms/compat/src/META-INF/ejb-jar.xml:
        * java/jms/compat/src/META-INF/jboss.xml:

Thu Aug  5 23:24:58 UTC 2010  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/OwnershipManager.cpp:

          - Made remove_writes(handle) to update all associated readers
          to reinit the ownership related cached data.
          - Fixed a bug in select_owner() that returned false when
          the provided writer with higher strength replace current owner.

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

        * dds/DCPS/InstanceState.cpp:

          Updated related methods to support the ownership cached data
          updates.

        * dds/DCPS/RequestedDeadlineWatchdog.cpp:

          Fixed execute() to call the listener, remove writes from
          OwnershipManager and status update once per missed deadline period.
          Previously it could be called twice when the timer is triggered
          and then a new sample is received and missed deadline, it could
          cause incorrect status counter.

        * tests/DCPS/Ownership/Writer.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/Ownership/publisher.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/Ownership/run_test.pl:

          Updated for missed deadline and liveliness change cases. The writers
          write more samples. The writer 2 has higher strength then writer 1.
          It sleeps for more than deadline or liveliness period after 5th sample,
          then the readers should receive samples from writer 1 after deadline
          missed or writer 2 liveliness lost. When writer 2 comes alive, the
          readers should receive samples from writer 2.

          The udp and multicast test fail due to UDP restriction on
          PDU size to 64K bytes. The udp and multicast test cases can be
          used in future if the UDP based fragmentation and reassembly
          is supported.

          Fixed nightly build warning. LONG_MAX and LONG_MIN
          are actually the unsigned long max and min for
          linux.

Wed Jul 14 20:56:38 UTC 2010  Brian Johnson  <johnsonb@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Definitions.h:

          Changed to use ACE_INT32.  Made SequenceNumber a class
          and provided accessors to value_.  Also made a typedef
          for ACE_INT32 to use when a SequenceNumber value is not
          being stored in a SequenceNumber.

        * dds/DCPS/DisjointSequence.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DisjointSequence.cpp:

          Added a dump() method to help debugging.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/MulticastConfiguration.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/MulticastConfiguration.cpp:

          Added nak_delay_intervals configuration parameter to define the
          number of intervals between naks after the initial nak.  This
          makes the initial nak sent right away and resend after delayed
          intervals. This could reduce naks.

          Added nak_max configuration parameter to limit the maximum number
          of times a missing sample will be nak'ed for.  Set this parameter
          so the nak will be not be sent repeatedly for the unrecoverable
          packets.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/ReliableSession.h:

          Changed NakRequestMap from multimap to map as the key is
          always unique.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/ReliableSession.cpp:

          Changed expire_naks() to remove looping through nak requests,
          to shift the sequence baseline instead of resetting it, and
          to make time out message clearer.

          Changed send_naks() to use new configuration parameters
          nak_delay_intervals and nak_max.  Missing samples will now be
          nak'ed for on the first nak_interval and then after every
          nak_delay_intervals until the missing sample has been nak'ed
          for nak_max times or the nak_timeout has expired.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/multicast.ini-dist:

          Added new configurations.

        * dds/idl/CPPTemplate.txt:

          Excluded disposal and unregister messages from check for
          max samples as this was causing these messages to be lost.

Mon Jul 12 20:54:17 UTC 2010  Brian Johnson  <johnsonb@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Definitions.h:

          Change operator< to double the distance and compare this with
          the range of valid positive values so that < would never be ambiguious,
          since the distance will always be even and range is odd.  Error was
          exposed by UnitTests/SequenceNumber.cpp lines 38 and 42.

        * dds/DCPS/DisjointSequence.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/DisjointSequence.cpp:

          Added private function to determine what the previous sequence
          number should be.  Error was exposed by
          UnitTest/DisjointSequence.cpp lines 213-223.

        * tests/DCPS/UnitTests/DisjointSequence.cpp:

          Added tests to expose errors in DisjointSequence logic.

          Corrected the behave when subscriber has INSTANCE or TOPIC
          presentation qos and publisher has GROUP presentation qos.

        * dds/DCPS/DomainParticipantImpl.cpp:

          Added check for nil bit_pub_dr_ in ownership_manager().
          This prevents crash when builtin topic is turned off in a non
          minimum bit build.

Fri Jul  9 20:14:17 UTC 2010  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/OwnershipManager.cpp:

          Fixed a bug that adds same writer to ownership candidate
          list multiple times when its strength is changed to be greater
          than current owner. This was observed from subscriber log in
          ownership update_strength test.

        * tests/DCPS/Ownership/Writer.cpp:

          Add one second delay before reset the writer strength to be higher,
          so the builtin topic data update arrives only after samples with
          previous strength on subscriber side. This helps simplify result
          verification on subscriber side.

          Fixed crash on linux due to ACE_CString passed as string format
          logging parameter.

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          Added a map to WriterInfo to keep track whether ownership need
          be evaluated for each instance. Previously, it used single flag
          for all instances sent by the writer. This is the bug that cause
          only samples belong the first instance were received when higher
          strength writer took ownership and published multiple instances.

        * dds/DCPS/DomainParticipantImpl.cpp:

          Fixed a deadlock issue that caused by reverse locking between
          DomainParticipantImpl subscribers_protector_ and ReceiveListenerSet
          lock_. This happened when one thread deleting subscriber from
          delete_contained_entities() while the reactor thread delievered
          builtin topic data sample and called BitPubListenerImpl to update
          ownership strength.

        * dds/DCPS/OwnershipManager.h:
        * dds/DCPS/OwnershipManager.cpp:

          Passed instance handle to some methods to help debugging.

          Renamed global variable "delay" to avoid conflict with QNX system
          headers.

        * tests/DCPS/UnitTests/LivelinessCompatibility.cpp:

          Need another #include for inline=0 GCC 3.3.x compatibility.

Fri Jun 25 20:47:38 UTC 2010  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/Ownership/subscriber.cpp:

          Moved result verify after Service_Participant shutdown.
          This would fix pure function called error on linux due
          to earlier result verify which failed sometimes.

Fri Jun 25 18:36:19 UTC 2010  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * bin/dcps_tests.lst:

          Marked the Ownership update_strength test only run
          when built in topic is enabled.

        * dds/DCPS/OwnershipManager.cpp:

          Fixed a memory corruption due to a possibility to
          erase vector end.

          More GCC 3.3.x work-arounds.

        * dds/idl/be_produce.cpp:

          Use main_filename() instead of filename() since some pre-processors
          use a temporary filename (SunCC).

        * examples/DCPS/Messenger_IOGR_Imr/Messenger_IOGR_Imr.mpc:

          Make sure we get rules.dds.GNU included in the makefile.

        * tests/DCPS/ViewState/ViewState.mpc:
        * tests/DCPS/ZeroCopyRead/ZeroCopyRead.mpc:

        * tests/DCPS/SharedTransport/TestCase.cpp:

          Added 2 seconds delay before writing samples for test with udp
          transport as the udp does not do fully association establishment
          between pub and sub.

Tue Jun 22 16:13:59 UTC 2010  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * dds/idl/opendds_idl.mpc:

          In the verbatim(gnuace), add the "all" target as a prerequisite of
          "idl_stubs" so that if the user runs "make idl_stubs", opendds_idl
          will be built first.

Tue Jun 22 14:29:51 UTC 2010  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/CoherentChangeControl.cpp:

          Added newline at the end of the file to avoid a GCC warning and for
          general consistency.

        * dds/idl/be_global.cpp:

          WCHAR compatibility.

        * dds/idl/opendds_idl.mpc:

          Use the same logic from tao_idl.mpc to set a preprocessor macro that
          tells opendds_idl which preprocessor to use at runtime.

        * tests/DCPS/GroupPresentation/SubscriberListener.h:
        * tests/DCPS/GroupPresentation/SubscriberListener.cpp:

Mon Jun 21 17:47:44 UTC 2010  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * Merged the branch "sbir_n08_116", which includes changes for spec
          compliance.  See docs/history/ChangeLog-sbir_n08_116 for details.
          Major features added are:

          - Content-Subscription Profile: implemented ContentFilteredTopic and
            the remaining functionality for QueryCondition
          - QoS: OWNERSHIP; PRESENTATION (access_scope = GROUP)

          The Content-Subscription Profile implementation required a change to
          OpenDDS's strategy for code-generation.  OpenDDS-specific code has
          been moved out of tao_idl's back-end library (enabled with -Gdcps)
          and into a code generator here in the OpenDDS repository, called
          opendds_idl (in dds/idl).  Existing applications that use MPC should
          only need to change one of the arguments which may appear in
          dcps_ts_flags: '--export=' has become '-Wb,export_macro='.
          Also, note that for footprint-sensitive applications, the content-
          subscription profile can be disabled at compile-time by setting the
          MPC feature content_subscription=0.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/udp/UdpTransport.cpp:

          Supported same transport pub-sub associations (see RT13902).
          - Added is_loopback and is_active flag to Datalink to help identify
            the active(pub) end or passive(sub) end.
          - For SimpleTCP, the links to same remote are seperated for active
            and passive side.
          - UDP was not changed as it's already seperated with the active
            and passive links.
          - Multicast transport creates two links (one link is for pubs and
            one is for subs) instead of single link per transport. As before,
            each link could have multiple sessions.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/dummyTCP/DummyTcpDataLink.cpp:

          Accommodated for function prototype changes.

        * tests/DCPS/SharedTransport/TestCase.cpp:

          Turned on message logging for verify.

        * tests/DCPS/SharedTransport/run_test.pl:
