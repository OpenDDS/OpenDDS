    <p>
      OpenDDS is an open-source C++ implementation of the Object Management Group's
      specification "Data Distribution Service for Real-time Systems".  Although
      OpenDDS is itself developed in C++, Java and JMS bindings are provided so
      that Java applications can use OpenDDS.
    </p>
    <p>
      OpenDDS is built on the <a href="http://www.theaceorb.com/product/aboutace.html">ACE</a>
      abstraction layer to provide platform portability.  OpenDDS also leverages
      capabilities of <a href="http://www.theaceorb.com/">TAO</a>, such as its IDL compiler
      and as the basis of the OpenDDS DCPS Information Repository (DCPSInfoRepo).
    </p>
    <p>
      The primary development of OpenDDS was done by the ACE/TAO development
      team at <a href="http://www.objectcomputing.com">Object Computing, Incorporated</a> in
      St. Louis and Phoenix.  It is released under the same generous license
      terms as ACE, TAO and MPC.  See the LICENSE file for details.

      <p>
	OpenDDS is based on version 1.4 of OMG Data Distribution Service (DDS) for Real-Time Systems specification (formal/2015-04-10)
	and version 2.2 of the Real-time Publish-Subscribe Wire Protocol DDS Interoperability Wire Protocol Specification (DDSI-RTPS) (formal/2014-09-01).
      </p>
      <p>
	It offers the following default transport protocols (IPv4 and IPv6):
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    TCP/IP
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    RTPS/UDP
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    UDP/IP
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    IP multicast
	  </li>
	</ul>
	The <a href="transport.html">pluggable transport framework</a> allows anyone to create a
	transport to fit custom requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
	OpenDDS has been found to perform better than other TAO
	services (notification and real-time event channel) by a factor of two
	or three. The features offered by the Real-Time Event Channel and Notification Service are similar to DDS,
	but not identical, so carefully examine your use-cases before choosing
	one service over another. Speed is not the only criterion.

    <a name="Compliance"><span class="headertext">Compliance with the DDS Specification</span></a>
    <p>
      OpenDDS supports the following capabilities defined in the DDS Specification:
    </p>
    <p>
      All profiles (including optional profiles) of the DCPS layer are implemented.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Built-In Topic functionality is available and enabled by default.  To disable
      Built-in Topic support pass "-NOBITS" option to DCPSInfoRepo and "-DcpsBit 0" to all
      clients.
    </p>
    <p>
      Developers can define a structure in IDL that will be used as a DDS data type.  The
      structure may include basic scalar types, strings, sequences, arrays, enumeration and
      unions.  It may not contain interfaces or value types.  Zero or more keys can be specified
      for a data type.

      <p>
	Performance testing of OpenDDS can be performed using the <strong>OpenDDS-Bench</strong>
	performance testing framework. This framework is currently located at:
      </p>
      <div>
	<pre>$DDS_ROOT/performance-tests/Bench</pre>
      </div>							<p>
	in the OpenDDS source code distribution. Detailed information
	about the OpenDDS-Bench framework is located at:
      </p>
      <div>
	<pre>$DDS_ROOT/performance-tests/Bench/doc/userguide.html</pre>
      </div>							<p>
	<a href="performance.html#Configuration">Tests are configured</a>
	using files.  The configuration files for some tests are included in
	the OpenDDS distribution and can be used to repeat the testing
	reported here in a user's environment. This way, users can compare
	existing or other candidate data transport mechanisms in their
	specific target environment to <a href="performance.html">these results</a>.
	The <a href="performance.html#Environment">test environments</a>
	include both OCI and customer test labs.
      </p>
      <p>
	Some testing was performed in the <a href="../perf/ocilab.html">OCI training laboratory</a>.
	These tests
	are representative of performance in a busy, user-driven environment of
	many desktop hosts with other tasks sharing the processing and network
	resources along with the test execution. Testing in this environment
	leads to noisy results, but demonstrates the performance of OpenDDS
	under actual, adverse, conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
	Additional testing was performed on a <a href="../perf/sgilab.html">single, multi-core box</a>.
	While this configuration is unlikely to be commonly deployed, its
	purpose is to establish the baseline behavior of OpenDDS in a
	non-networked environment. Therefore, the latency numbers are those
	that directly result from the running of the publisher and subscriber,
	in different threads, on the same box, in loopback mode so as to
	ensure that the entire transport stack is exercised.
      </p>
      <p>
	This baseline behavior on a single host can, of course, be improved by
	employing shared memory transport and other techniques. Therefore, the
	performance characteristics reported in the single-host case do not
	represent the lowest possible latency for OpenDDS. They are intended
	to provide a reference measurement.  For instance, testing with
	various processor speeds shows that OpenDDS improves in almost a
	directly proportional manner.
	Further testing will be performed on boxes with faster processor speeds as they
	become available to reaffirm this conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
	When OpenDDS is introduced into a more typical network setting, additional
	latency will accrue, of course, depending on the network protocol, topology,
	distance and network hardware, etc. In general, when measuring the latency in
	networked settings, these other factors may well swamp the baseline results
	seen here. The testing in the OCI training lab shows that latency might be
	two to three times greater on a general purpose LAN. (See the <a href="performance.html">actual results</a>
	of tests performed at "OCI Lab".)
      </p>
      <p>
	Further performance testing will be performed on racked systems using
	the standard protocols supported such as TCP/IP. This configuration is
	increasingly commonly deployed for certain types of easily distributed
	tasks that require close cooperation. The advertised latency between
	boxes on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfiniBand">Infinband</a>,
	for example, is a few hundred nanoseconds. (Other rack fabrics offer
	similar numbers.) Therefore this should not cause much noticeable
	additional latency. Testing will confirm this.
      </p>
      <p>
	Comparison of the latency of OpenDDS with that of proprietary
	offerings indicates OpenDDS performs about the same as the fastest of
	its competitors. There is no advantage to be gained by purchasing a
	proprietary implementation.  The bottom line appears to be that when
	using the open source DDS product, the savings from license fees can
	be applied to network hardware, racks for co-located systems, etc. All
	these investments will yield a commensurate return.
