    <p>
      OpenDDS includes the OpenDDS Modeling Software Development Kit (SDK).  This is a set of tools
      to simplify using the Object Management Group (OMG) Data Distribution Service (DDS).
      This modeling SDK can be used to easily capture aspects of
      the DDS service that are not of interest to the application
      developer, leaving the developer free to devote more
      time to application issues rather than the details of internal
      middleware plumbing.  The modeling SDK is a set of <a href="#Plug-ins">Eclipse Plug-ins</a>
      that can be easily installed using the standard Eclipse installation mechanisms.
    </p>

    <p>
      To provide portability of widely used skills, the model uses standards-based
      UML modeling elements and should
      be familiar to users of other UML tools.  The elements
      available for describing a model are based on the
      metamodel described in <a href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?ptc/10-05-17.pdf">
        UML Profile For Data Distribution Specification</a> (OMG: ptc/2010-05-17).
      In turn, this specification reflects the DDS Platform
      Independent Model (PIM) defined in
      (<a href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/07-01-01">Data Distribution Service for Real-time Systems</a>
      (OMG: formal/07-01-01</a>).
  </p>

  <p>
    Once a model has been <a href="#Capture">captured</a>,
    it is used to <a href="#Generate">generate source code</a>.
    That source code is then compiled into
    link libraries that can be <a href="#Programming">linked into a user application</a>.
    Applications access the DDS API by instantiating classes
    generated from the model and accessing the Entities
    represented in the model by name.  The application is
    then free to send and receive data directly from the DDS
    defined Entities.  All of the features defined in the
    specification are available for use by applications when
    using code generated from a model.
  </p>

  <p>
    The SDK is built on top of the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/">Eclipse Modeling Framework</a> (EMF).
    Because of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Eclipse_Modeling_Framework_based_software">universal acceptance of EMF</a>,
    it is feasible to consider interoperability with other modeling tools.
    In addition, the OpenDDS Modeling SDK model files use the standards-based
    <a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/XMI/">XML Metadata Interchange</a> (XMI) format.
    This provides further opportunity for interoperability with tools that work with XMI files. To simplify this interoperability,
    the semantic model information is in one file and the graphical representation is in another. This separation allows diagrams to be
    created from semantic models obtained by other tools.
  </p>

  <p>
    The serialization schema for the semantic model content is available in XSD format.
    If legacy and other external data is converted into this format,
    then the SDK will be able to incorporate that data and make it available as if it were captured in the native SDK editors.

    <p>
      OpenDDS Modeling is provided via Eclipse plug-ins that include
      tools such as graphical model capture editors and code
      generation forms.  These plug-ins were developed for Eclipse Galileo (3.5)
      and have been successfully used with Helios (3.6) and Luna (4.4).
    </p>

    <p>
      To install the plug-ins, use the standard installation mechanism for Eclipse,
      an installation site is available for the tools at:
      <ul>
        <li>for Eclipse 3.x: <a href="http://download.opendds.org/modeling/eclipse">http://download.opendds.org/modeling/eclipse</a></li>
        <li>for Eclipse 4.4: <a href="http://download.opendds.org/modeling/eclipse">http://download.opendds.org/modeling/eclipse_44</a></li>
      </ul>
      The feature to install from that site is:
      <ul><li><em>OpenDDS Modeling SDK</em></li></ul>
      To simplify installation where a full Internet connection
      may not be available, the file:
      <ul>
        <li>for Eclipse 3.x: <a href="http://download.opendds.org/modeling/eclipse/opendds_modeling_site.zip">http://download.opendds.org/modeling/eclipse/opendds_modeling_site.zip</a></li>
        <li>for Eclipse 4.4: <a href="http://download.opendds.org/modeling/eclipse_44/opendds_modeling_site.zip">http://download.opendds.org/modeling/eclipse_44/opendds_modeling_site.zip</a></li>
      </ul>
      is available for download as well.  This can be used as
      a local archive for installation by Eclipse.

  <p>
    As mentioned in the introduction,
    a UML model defining DCPS elements and policies along
    with data definitions is captured using the graphical
    model capture editors included in the Eclipse plug-ins.
    The elements of the UML model follows the structure of
    the DDS UML Platform Independent Model (PIM) defined in
    the DDS specification
    (<a href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/07-01-01">OMG: formal/07-01-01</a>).
  </p>

  <p>
    Different diagram types are used to capture information
    in the model, including:
  <p>
    <table border>
      <tr><th>Diagram</th><th>Description</th></tr>

      <tr><td><code>main</code></td>
        <td>Captures information about packaging and contains
          elements representing each of the other diagrams included
          in the model.  This includes all of the DCPS, QoS, and
          Data diagrams that are included locally in the model.
          References to external model diagrams are possible from
          this diagram as well.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr><td><code>DCPS</code></td>
        <td>Captures information about the DCPS elements included
          in the model.  These are the DCPS Entities and their
          relationships.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr><td><code>QoS</code></td>
        <td>Captures information about Quality of Service
          policies that are used within the model.  These diagrams
          are used to share common sets of policy values between
          more than one element in the DCPS model.  Alternatively,
          the policy values can be set locally to the elements to
          which they apply.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr><td><code>Data</code></td>
        <td>Captures the data definitions for data types that
          will be transported by the DDS service.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </p>
  </p>
  <p>
    Opening a new OpenDDS model within the plug-ins begins
    with a top level <em>main</em> diagram.  This diagram
    includes any package structures to be included in the
    model along with the local QoS policy definitions,
    data definitions, and DCPS elements of the model.
  </p>

  <p>
    A model can contain references to other externally defined
    models. This supports reuse and concurrent development.
    To maximize this potential, models can be created for QoS policies only, data
    definitions only, or DCPS elements only and then be referenced
    in other models.  This allows sharing of data definitions and
    QoS policies among different DCPS models as well as including
    externally defined data in a new set of data definitions.
  </p>

    for more detailed information on capturing a model.

<div class="panel" align="justify">
  <a name="Generation"><span class="headertext">Code Generation</span></a>
  <span class="bodytext"><br />
    <p>
      Source code is then generated from the captured model
      using a separate forms based editor. The generated code can
      then be compiled into link libraries. These libraries provide the middleware
      elements defined in the model.  User applications can then utilize the
      middleware elements by linking to the libraries.
    </p>

    <p>
      Forms are used to customize and generate code from a
      model.  A file separate from the model file is used
      for this purpose.  This allows more than one set of code
      customization and generation instructions to be created for
      any single model.  The forms used to capture information
      about customization and code generation are:
      <table border>
        <tr><th>Form</th><th>Description</th></tr>

        <tr><td><code>Code Generation</code></td>
          <td>Specifies the model file to use for code generation
            and the target directory where the generated output
            files will be placed.  This form also includes the
            push button controls for generating the output files
            - one for generating all output files, and one for
            each output file that can be generated.</td></tr>

        <tr><td><code>Model Customization</code></td>
          <td>This form allows individual variants of a model
            to be specified to allow them to be created and used
            simultaneously.  The features which are unique to
            each variant include an offset to transport indices
            to avoid conflicts with transport index values.
            The transport configuration can also be specified
            directly for each transport in the model.</td></tr>

        <tr><td><code>Build Paths</code></td>
          <td>This form allows the developer to include paths
            to be searched at build time for include files and
            link libraries.  These paths can be specified as
            an environment variable that will be available at
            build time, a path, or a combination of the two:
            an environment variable with a path relative to
            the value of that variable.</td></tr>
      </table>
    </p>

    <p>
      Specifics of code generation are unique to the individual
      generation forms and are kept separate from the model
      for which generation is being performed.  Code generation
      is performed on a single model at a time and includes the
      ability to tailor the generated code as well as specifying
      search paths to be used for locating resources at build
      time.  The model to be generated from as well as the target
      directory into which the resulting generated source code
      will be placed are selectable via the forms interface.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is possible to generate model variations (separately
      instantiatable forms of the same model) that can then
      be created within the same application or different
      applications.  It is also possible to specify locations
      to search for header files and link libraries at build time.
    </p>

    <p>
      The files generated from a model include:
    <p>
      <table border>
        <tr><th>File</th><th>Description</th></tr>

        <tr><td><code>&lt;model&gt;.idl</code></td>
          <td>Includes the IDL data definitions for the model.
            The IDL compiler will convert these into C++
            files that can be included into the application.</td></tr>

        <tr><td><code>&lt;model&gt;Traits.h<br/>&lt;model&gt;Traits.cpp</code></td>
          <td>Includes customization and a definition of each
            model type that was specified to be generated.
            This is the only header that needs to be
            included in the application code.  It includes
            the remaining required files needed by the
            application, including the data definition files.
        </td></tr>

        <tr><td><code>&lt;model&gt;_T.h<br/>&lt;model&gt;_T.cpp</code></td>
          <td>This contains the actual model definition
            information that is customized by the traits.
            It defines the class that provides access to
            the DDS specified Entities and API.
        </td></tr>

        <tr><td><code>&lt;model&gt;.mpc<br/>&lt;model&gt;.mpb<br/>&lt;model&gt;_paths.mpb</code></td>
          <td>Build support files.  These files are used
            to build the linkable library of the model.
            They can also be used to simplify building of
            the application and any other libraries that
            include elements from this model.
        </td></tr>

      </table>
    </p>
    The build support files are based on the
    <a href="http://www.ociweb.com/products/MPC">MPC</a>
    portable build system used by OpenDDS itself.  It can be used to
    generate makefiles or project files for building the model
    libraries according to the development environment.

  <p>
    In order to use the middleware defined by a model,
    applications need to link in the generated code.
    This is done through header files and link libraries.
    Support for building applications using the MPC portable
    build tool is included in the generated files.
  </p>

  <p>
    Application access to the DDS API is provided through
    a class for each model that will be created within the
    application.  A single header file per model should be
    included which defines the model classes.  In addition, a
    separate support class needs to be instantiated in order
    to manage the lifetime of the OpenDDS service within
    the application.
