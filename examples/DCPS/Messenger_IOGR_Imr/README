This test builds upon the Messenger_Imr test.

Status: Still under development.

This test incarnates multiple instances of ImRified InfoRepo's and
ties them all together into a single IOGR. This can be used as
a FT strategy for clients to automatically switch over to a backup
InfoRepo in case of an InfoRepo instance crash.
