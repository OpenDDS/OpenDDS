This test builds upon the DevGuide Messenger example.

This test showcases how the DCPSInforepo can be used in combination
 with the TAO ImplmentationReposity service (ImR). The test starts
 up the ImR and the Activator Service (AtS). It then starts up the
 InfoRepo with the -ORBuseimr option turned on. Th InfoRepo in this
 mode will register with the ImR and writes out an ImRified IOR. The
 test driver then kills the ImplRepo.

The utility tao_imr is used to updated the ImR's ImplRepo index with
 the information needed by the AtS to reincarnate the InfoRepo. From
 here on the test mirrors the regular messenger test. Whats different
 is that when the first DDS client (Publisher) tries to register with
 the InfoRepo, it has top wait for the ImR (specifically the Activator)
 to reincarnate the InfoRepo.

Concerns:

One issue is how the system would behave if the InfoRepo crashes after
 the DDS client has established a connection. Would TAO detect the broken
 connection and establish a new connection (via the ImR) or would it just
 throw a TRANSIENT exception?
My guess is that TAO would try to re-establish connection using the IOR
 previously returned by the ImR. If the InfoRepo is alive and listening
 on the same port, alls well. If however the InfoRepo isn't alive
 the client will get a CORBA exception. It would then have to repeat
 the invocation for the ImR assisted connection establishment (including
 InfoRepo reincarnation) to happen.
If this is correct we need to have a try-catch block around every
 InfoRepo invocation and repeat the invocation upon catching any
 exception.
