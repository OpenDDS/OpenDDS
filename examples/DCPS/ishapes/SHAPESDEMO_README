The ishapes program is intended to be used alongside the Shapes Demo
walkthrough on the OpenDDS website (link below).  The examples there
provide help to begin to familiarize one with some Data Distribution
Service (DDS) concepts by making use of the included application.

The demo application code has been adapted from The Simple DDS API
(SIMD https://code.google.com/archive/p/simd-cxx/), and can be used to demonstrate
OpenDDS RTPS interoperability with other DDS vendors.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
System Requirements:

* Qt 5 was used to create the provided application.

Demo Application:

ishapes - QT GUI application for testing OpenDDS RTPS interoperability.

  * ishapes program can accept a command line argument to specify the
    partition to be used by this instance of the application by using

    -partition "<VAL>"  where <VAL> should be replaced with the partition
                        for instance "A" or alternatively "*" can be
                        used to specify inclusion in all partitions.
