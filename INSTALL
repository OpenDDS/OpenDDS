BUILDING OpenDDS
========================

* Supported platforms:

  We have built OpenDDS on number of different platforms and compilers.  See
  $DDS_ROOT/README.md for a complete description of supported platforms.


* Compiling:

  OpenDDS has a "configure" script to automate all steps required before
  actually compiling source code.  This script requires Perl 5.10 or newer to be
  installed and available on the system PATH.  Perl 5.8 may be sufficient on
  Unix systems but ActiveState Perl 5.10 or newer should be used on Windows.
  To start the script simply change to the directory containing this INSTALL
  file, and run

  ./configure         (Linux, MacOSX, Solaris)
  configure           (Windows: use a Visual Studio Command Prompt)

  Optionally add "--help" to the command line to see the advanced options
  available for this script.  The configure script will download ACE+TAO and
  configure it for your platform.  To use an existing ACE+TAO installation,
  either set the ACE_ROOT and TAO_ROOT environment variables or pass the --ace
  and --tao (if TAO is not at $ACE_ROOT/TAO) options to configure.
  If configure runs successfully it will end with a message about the next
  steps for compiling OpenDDS.

  The configure script creates an environment setup file called setenv (actually
  named setenv.sh or setenv.cmd depending on platform) that restores all the
  environment variables the build and test steps rely on.
  The main makefile for non-Windows builds temporarily sets the environment as
  well, so setenv.sh is not needed when running "make" from the top level.
  On Windows, the configure script modifies the environment of the command
  prompt that ran it.


* Test:

  Optionally, you can run the entire OpenDDS regression test suite with one
  Perl command.

  NOTE: Make sure your environment is set by checking the variable DDS_ROOT.
        Run setenv if it is not set.

  bin/auto_run_tests.pl        (On Windows: bin\auto_run_test.pl)
      If you built static libraries, add "-Config STATIC" to this command.
      To test RTPS features (uses multicast) add "-Config RTPS" to this command.
      On Windows if you build Release mode add "-ExeSubDir Release".
      On Windows if you build static libraries add "-ExeSubDir Static_Debug"
      or "-ExeSubDir Static_Release".


* Installation:

  When OpenDDS is built using make, if the configure script was run with an
  argument of "--prefix=<dir>" the "make install" target is available.

  After running "make" (and before "make install") you have one completely ready
  and useable OpenDDS.  Its DDS_ROOT is the top of the source tree -- the same
  directory from which you ran configure and make.  That DDS_ROOT should work
  for building application code, and some users may prefer using it this way.

  After "make install" there is a second completely ready and useable OpenDDS
  that's under the installation prefix directory.  It comes with a one-line
  shell script in <prefix>/share/dds/dds-devel.sh that sets a DDS_ROOT which
  is used for building an application using this installed OpenDDS.  The
  analogous files for ACE and TAO are in <prefix>/share/ace/ace-devel.sh and
  <prefix>/share/tao/tao-devel.sh.


* Cross Compiling:

  Use the configure script, and set the target platform to one different than
  the host.  For example:

  ./configure --target=lynxos-178

  Run configure with "--target-help" for details on the supported targets.
  In this setup, configure will clone the DDS and ACE+TAO source trees for host
  and target builds.  It will do a static build of the host tools (such as
  opendds_idl and tao_idl) in the host environment, and a full build in the
  target environment.  Most parameters to configure are then assumed to be
  target parameters.

  Any testing has to be done manually.


* Getting Started building your own applications:

  See the OpenDDS Developer's Guide:
      http://download.ociweb.com/OpenDDS/OpenDDS-latest.pdf

  Run the Developer's Guide Example program:
  Unix                                            Windows
  ----                                            -------
  cd $DDS_ROOT/DevGuideExamples/DCPS/Messenger    cd %DDS_ROOT%\DevGuideExam...
  ./run_test.pl                                   perl run_test.pl
  [ see the notes in section "Test", above, for options to run_test.pl ]

  The Perl script will start 3 processes, the DCPSInfoRepo, one publisher, and
  one subscriber.  Note that the command lines used to spawn these processes
  are echoed back to standard output.  The options and config files used here
  are helpful starting points for developing and running your own OpenDDS
  applications.
