## Version 3.25.0 of OpenDDS

Released 2023-07-20

Download [this release on GitHub](https://github.com/OpenDDS/OpenDDS/releases/tag/DDS-3.25).

Read [the documentation for this release on Read the Docs](https://opendds.readthedocs.io/en/dds-3.25).

### Additions

* The Observer interface now has support for dispose and unregister. ([PR #4137](https://github.com/OpenDDS/OpenDDS/pull/4137))
* OpenDDS now stores configuration information in a key-value store. ([PR #4138](https://github.com/OpenDDS/OpenDDS/pull/4138), [PR #4134](https://github.com/OpenDDS/OpenDDS/pull/4134), [PR #4151](https://github.com/OpenDDS/OpenDDS/pull/4151))
    * Configuration values can be set via API, config file, or command line.

        * Currently applies to the common section and common transport configuration.

* Added `encode_to_string`, `encode_to_bytes`, `decode_from_string`, and `decode_from_bytes` to `TypeSupport`. ([PR #4144](https://github.com/OpenDDS/OpenDDS/pull/4144), [PR #4122](https://github.com/OpenDDS/OpenDDS/pull/4122), [PR #4133](https://github.com/OpenDDS/OpenDDS/pull/4133), [PR #4135](https://github.com/OpenDDS/OpenDDS/pull/4135))
    * These methods convert samples to and from other formats.
    * Currently only `OpenDDS::DCPS::JSON_DATA_REPRESENTATION` is supported.

* Add `-Gequality` option to opendds_idl to generate `==` and `!=` for structs and unions. ([PR #4154](https://github.com/OpenDDS/OpenDDS/pull/4154))
    * The members of the struct or union must have a type that could appear in a DDS topic and be supported by opendds_idl.
    * The motivation for this change was to make the generated code more useful as many users go on to define these operators.

* CMake Config Package

    * Added [executable targets](https://opendds.readthedocs.io/en/dds-3.25/building/cmake.html#cmake-executables). ([PR #4160](https://github.com/OpenDDS/OpenDDS/pull/4160))
    * [`OPENDDS_CMAKE_VERBOSE`](https://opendds.readthedocs.io/en/dds-3.25/building/cmake.html#var-OPENDDS_CMAKE_VERBOSE) output has been expanded, but now accepts a list of categories to control how much is logged. ([PR #4160](https://github.com/OpenDDS/OpenDDS/pull/4160))
    * Added [`opendds_export_header`](https://opendds.readthedocs.io/en/dds-3.25/building/cmake.html#func-opendds_export_header) to generate an export header. ([PR #4160](https://github.com/OpenDDS/OpenDDS/pull/4160))
    * [`opendds_target_sources`](https://opendds.readthedocs.io/en/dds-3.25/building/cmake.html#func-opendds_target_sources):
        * Added [`opendds_target_sources(GENERATE_SERVER_SKELETONS)`](https://opendds.readthedocs.io/en/dds-3.25/building/cmake.html#func-arg-opendds_target_sources-GENERATE_SERVER_SKELETONS) to allow `tao_idl` to generate code for CORBA servers. ([PR #4140](https://github.com/OpenDDS/OpenDDS/pull/4140))
        * Added [`opendds_target_sources(AUTO_LINK)`](https://opendds.readthedocs.io/en/dds-3.25/building/cmake.html#func-arg-opendds_target_sources-AUTO_LINK) as a fine-grained version of [`OPENDDS_AUTO_LINK_DCPS`](https://opendds.readthedocs.io/en/dds-3.25/building/cmake.html#var-OPENDDS_AUTO_LINK_DCPS). ([PR #4140](https://github.com/OpenDDS/OpenDDS/pull/4140))
        * Added [`opendds_target_sources(SKIP_TAO_IDL)`](https://opendds.readthedocs.io/en/dds-3.25/building/cmake.html#func-arg-opendds_target_sources-SKIP_TAO_IDL) to disable `tao_idl`. ([PR #4140](https://github.com/OpenDDS/OpenDDS/pull/4140))
        * Added [`opendds_target_sources(SKIP_OPENDDS_IDL)`](https://opendds.readthedocs.io/en/dds-3.25/building/cmake.html#func-arg-opendds_target_sources-SKIP_OPENDDS_IDL) to disable `opendds_idl`. ([PR #4140](https://github.com/OpenDDS/OpenDDS/pull/4140))
        * Added [`opendds_target_sources(USE_EXPORT)`](https://opendds.readthedocs.io/en/dds-3.25/building/cmake.html#func-arg-opendds_target_sources-USE_EXPORT) to allow overriding the generated export header with an existing one. ([PR #4160](https://github.com/OpenDDS/OpenDDS/pull/4160))

    * Libraries and features can be passed to `find_package(OpenDDS COMPONENTS)` to change what is required. ([PR #4160](https://github.com/OpenDDS/OpenDDS/pull/4160), [PR #4140](https://github.com/OpenDDS/OpenDDS/pull/4140))

        * See [Components](https://opendds.readthedocs.io/en/dds-3.25/building/cmake.html#cmake-components) for details.

### Security

* Fixed issue deserializing bounded sequences with JSON ([PR #4150](https://github.com/OpenDDS/OpenDDS/pull/4150))
    * The deserialization will fail if the JSON input contains more elements than the bounded sequence can hold.

* Updated the RtpsRelay's tracking of client IP addresses so they are removed when no longer used. ([PR #4202](https://github.com/OpenDDS/OpenDDS/pull/4202))

    * The RtpsRelay configuration option -MaxAddrSetSize was renamed to -MaxIpsPerClient

### Documentation

* Moved various markdown files into the Sphinx documentation so that they are now included along with the Developer's Guide: ([PR #4139](https://github.com/OpenDDS/OpenDDS/pull/4139))
    * `INSTALL.md` is now [Building and Installing](https://opendds.readthedocs.io/en/dds-3.25/building/index.html).
    * `docs/dependencies.md` is now [Dependencies](https://opendds.readthedocs.io/en/dds-3.25/building/dependencies.html).

### Notes

* CMake Config Package

    * `OPENDDS_TARGET_SOURCES` is now called `opendds_target_sources`. ([PR #4140](https://github.com/OpenDDS/OpenDDS/pull/4140))

        * CMake macros and functions names are case insensitive, so this should have no effect on CMake code.

## Version 3.24.2 of OpenDDS
OpenDDS 3.24.2 was released on Jun 30 2023.

### Security:
- Fixed a vulnerability in the rtps_udp transport where an acknowledgement sequence number beyond the maximum expected by the writer leads to an assert and incorrect state. (#4155)
  - Thanks to Seulbae Kim (@squizz617) for discovering this.

### Fixes:
- Fixed leaked shared memory by the shared memory transport. (#4171)
  - For a 100% fix, a new ACE version including https://github.com/DOCGroup/ACE_TAO/pull/2077 must be used.
- Fixed bug introduced by #4120 (#4180, #4184)
  - The fix introduced in #4120 causes the TransportClient to silently drop messages when the client's guid is not initialized.
    This causes issues for TransportClients that send messages to the transport before association.
    One such example is a DataWriter with liveliness configured.
    The DataWriter will send liveliness messages to the transport (which will be dropped) and hang waiting for them to be delivered.
  - The solution was set the guid for a TransportClient before calling any method that uses the guid.

### Notes:
- #4180 required changes in InfoRepoDiscovery's IDL, so InfoRepo compatibility with older versions has been broken.

## Version 3.24.1 of OpenDDS
OpenDDS 3.24.1 was released on Apr 21 2023.

### Fixes:
- Fixed compile warnings in TypeSupport that can happen with GCC and `-O2` or higher (#4117)
- Fixed compile error in TypeSupport for IDL that contains a typedef of a typedef (#4117)
- Fixed bug in the tcp transport where readers and writers can fail to associate (#4120)
- Fixed issue in some headers that could leak `#pragma pack (push, 8)` into user code on Visual Studio (#4123)
- Fixed theoretical infinite loop in rtps_udp transport code (#4124)

### Documentation:
- Removed invalid links and references in README and the Developer's Guide and fixed other minor issues (#4115, #4116, #4121, #4126)
- Changed theme used by the Sphinx documentation to make the Developer's Guide easier to navigate (#4127)
- Added copy buttons to embedded code and code-like examples (#4127)

## Version 3.24.0 of OpenDDS
OpenDDS 3.24.0 was released on Apr 11 2023.

  - The Sphinx/reStructuredText source for this new format is now located in the repo at `docs/devguide`
- DOCGroup ACE6/TAO2 is now the default ACE/TAO for OpenDDS, OCI ACE/TAO is no longer supported (#4069)
- Dynamic content subscription (#3988)
  - This allows `DynamicDataReader`s to use `QueryCondition` and `ContentFilteredTopic` and allows `DynamicDataWriter`s to do filtering on behalf of matched `DataReader`s that use `ContentFilteredTopic`.
- `DynamicData`:
  - Can now read and write enum members as strings (#4022)
  - `get_int64_value` and `get_uint64_value` can now cast from different types (#4078)
  - `DynamicDataImpl` now uses lazy initialization to reduce memory usage (#4024)
- Added aliases for IDL types from XTypes spec such as `DDS::UInt32` (#3994)
  - See `DdsDcpsCore.idl` for all of them.
- Added PublicationMatchedStatus Current Count To RtpsRelay Statistics (#4006)
- Allow reassembly of overlapping fragment ranges in RTPS (#4035, #4047)
- Can now cross-compile on macOS (#4048)
- Added hardening features to RtpsRelay (#4045)
  - These are configured with the new options `-MaxAddrSetSize` and `-RejectedAddressDuration`.
- Added `OPENDDS_AUTO_LINK_DCPS` and `OPENDDS_USE_CORRECT_INCLUDE_SCOPE` global options to the CMake package (#4071)
- Expanded support for using C++ keywords in IDL (#4073)
- Improved support for anonymous types in unions branches (#4078)
- IDL file and generated TypeSupport.idl can now be in different directories (#4077)

### Fixes:
- Fixed `rtps_relay_address_change` deadlocks (#3989)
- Fixed RtpsUdpTransport data race from `relay_stun_mutex_` (#3990)
- Fixed invalid socket handles in RtpsUdpTransport (#4002)
- Fixed index increment in `GuidPartitionTable::prepare_relay_partitions` (#4005)
- Fixed a bug in content filtering with enum comparisons on serialized samples (#4038)
- Fixed transport config and transport instance derived from template conflicting (#4058)
- Improved reliability of the shared memory transport (#4028)
- Secure writers and readers in same participant can now associate (#4041)
- Fixed issue with using `-o` in `tao_idl`/`opendds_idl` options in `OPENDDS_TARGET_SOURCES` and those directories are now automatically included (#4071)
- XTypes (#4078):
  - `TypeObject`s struct and union members used to be sorted by member ID, but they are now sorted by declaration order as the XTypes spec calls for.
    By default member IDs increment starting at 0, and in that case the `TypeObject`s will be the same.
    If `@autoid(hash)`, `--default-autoid hash`, or `@id(ID)` are being used then the order could be different.
    This could cause some reader/writer matching incompatibility with older versions of OpenDDS:
    - Topics with final and appendable structs will no longer match.
    - If `DISALLOW_TYPE_COERCION` QoS is being used, then all topics where the order differ will not longer match.
      Note that this is true for any time the type hash changes.
    - Pass the `--old-typeobject-member-order` option to `opendds_idl` to use the non-standard order.
  - The size of XCDR2 member parameters in mutable structs and unions is now correctly interpreted when the "length code" is 5, 6, or 7.
    - This is an optimization that OpenDDS doesn't serialize samples with, so this could only be an issue when dealing with samples from other DDS implementations.
  - `DynamicDataImpl` (`DynamicData` made by `DynamicDataFactory` that can be passed to `DynamicDataWriter`):
    - `get_member_id_at_index` now returns ids for members that haven't been initialized yet.
    - Fixed incorrect serialization of keyed unions for instance registration, disposal, and unregistration samples.
    - Fixed errors from serializing some cases of arrays and sequences.

### Notes:

### Notes:
- For the `rtps_udp` transport, the default encoding of DataWriters changed
  from classic CDR to XCDR2. To maintain interoperability with pre-3.16 OpenDDS
  and other DDS implementations, the first element of `representation.value` of
  `DataWriterQos` must be set to `DDS::XCDR_DATA_REPRESENTATION` or the
  non-OpenDDS 3.16 DataReader must be set up with
  `DDS::XCDR2_DATA_REPRESENTATION` if supported. DataReaders will continue to
  be interoperable by default.

- Fixed a few reference counting issues in internal classes

### Notes:
- This is the final version we will test with TAO 2.0a, please upgrade to a newer TAO (see README.md)

## Version 3.9 of OpenDDS

- Updated how DataWriter QoS is interpreted by internal data structures:
  - RESOURCE\_LIMITS.max\_samples\_per\_instance controls total samples that can be
    stored per instance, independent of HISTORY
  - HISTORY.depth controls number of samples (per instance) that will be made
    available to late-joining readers if DURABILITY is enabled
    - KEEP\_ALL history uses max\_samples\_per\_instance as its depth
  - WriteDataContainer is more eager to remove samples that are no longer needed
  - WriteDataContainer will not remove samples that are required to implement
    DURABILITY, hence if RELIABILITY is enabled this can block a write() just
    like other "no resource available" scenarios

- Fixed an RTPS interoperability issue with the new ParticipantMessageData
  messages (used for liveliness)

- Enhanced RTPS support for DURABILITY QoS enabling faster reader/writer
  associations when DURABILITY is in use (set to TRANSIENT\_LOCAL)

- RTPS Discovery has a new option "SpdpLocalAddress" which can be used to
  bind SPDP's socket to a particular network interface

- InfoRepo discovery will use TAO's BiDir GIOP feature to reduce number
  of sockets needed (disable with -DCPSBidirGIOP 0)

- Intermediate Type Language (itl), a helper library used by the OpenDDS
  wireshark dissector, is now included in the source tree in
  tools/IntermediateTypeLang.  itl depends on the 3rd-pary lib rapidjson.
  When running the configure script, use --rapidjson=<location>

- Corrected makefile generation for Java bindings with IDL bounded strings

- Fixed a bug where some header files would be missing from "make install"

- "make install" now works with Java bindings

- Configure script: now supports FreeBSD, Mac OS X El Capitan,
  and cross-compiles for Linux targets (Raspberry Pi and Intel Edison tested).
  The configure script attempts to find the JDK if invoked with --java.

- cross-compilation now works with Java bindings, including use of JRE compact1



## Version 3.8 of OpenDDS

- Improved support for Safety Profile

- OpenDDS multicast transport (reliable mode) now guarantees in-order delivery

- Added a "default address" configuration parameter that sets an overall default
  for binding to a specific network interface

- Fixed bugs in transport framework, udp transport, InfoRepo discovery, static
  discovery, and the Liveliness and Durability QoS policies


## Version 3.7 of OpenDDS

### Additions:
- Implements FACE Transport Services API v2.1, FACE safety base and
  FACE safety extended profiles (Future Airborne Capability Environment).
- Implements DDS 1.4 and RTPS 2.2.
- Support allocations from memory pool in safety profile builds.  Introduced
  standard library containers and strings, as well as TAO sequences that
  allocate from this pool.
- To support FACE TS, the IDL struct DDS::SampleInfo has a new field
  opendds\_reserved\_publication\_seq as an extension to the DDS specification.
- Updated opendds\_idl for FACE support, moving some of the code-generation
  from tao\_idl to opendds\_idl when targeting FACE TS.
- Support IDL fixed type inside of DCPS\_DATA\_TYPE (used with FACE TS).
- Type-specific DataWriterImpl and DataReaderImpl are now templates.  Code
  generation now introduces a typedef of these.
- Content filtering now supports modulus (MOD) operator as an extension.
- Added a static (configuration-based) discovery mechanism.
- RTPS Discovery is now supported when OpenDDS is built without built-in topics.
- RTPS Discovery has a new configuration parameter SedpLocalAddress which
  configures the rtps\_udp transport used internally by discovery in the same way
  that local\_address configures a user-created rtps\_udp transport instance.
- Support non-default liveliness QOS in rtps\_udp transport.
- Support wait\_for\_acknowledgements in rtps\_udp transport.
- Support command line option -DCPSRTISerialization when integrating with RTI
  DDS using RTPS, to account for a different serialization algorithm.
- Configure script handles some cross-compile builds and safety profile.
- Support for new Visual Studio compilers (vc11, vc12, and vc14).
- Support for clang builds on Mac OS X.
- Removed support for old GCC compilers (<= 3.3).
- opendds\_idl command-line option -Gitl is a replacement for -Gws.  Wireshark
  dissector now reads ITL files, rather than .ini files.

### Fixes:
- Fixed many tests for minimum profile builds.
- Enforced correct behavior of a reliable data writer when history QoS
  is set to KEEP\_LAST with depth=1.
- opendds\_idl can now be specified in user\_macros.GNU instead of always
  assuming it is in $DDS\_ROOT/bin (for -type gnuace builds).
- Fixed initial IPv6 support in windows builds.
- Fixed disassociate handling of local entities on loopback interface.
- Corrected wait\_for\_acknowedgements for non-reliable writers to return
  success immediately.
- Allow disassociating readers to finish processing messages from active writer
  before removing.
- Remove TcpDataLink from DataLinkSet when connect() fails.  Previously, the
  datalink would remain and would be seen as a fully-connected datalink by new
  associations.
- DCPSTransportDebugLevel 1 messages are now association-oriented.
- Fixed durable resend out-of-order handling for rtps\_udp transport.
- Fixed handling of acknowledgements during shutdown of rtps\_udp data link.
- RTPS Discovery now ignores 'RTPX' messages seen during RTI integration.
- Dissection of unions in wireshark dissector (requires ITL).
- Corrected reference counting scheme for Recorder and Replayer objects:
  the reference-counted handle types changed from \_rch to \_var.

### Notes:
- OCI no longer builds with vc71, vc8, and GCC 4.1.1.  If you require support
  of these older platforms contact sales@ociweb.com.
- The project repository is now at https://github.com/objectcomputing/OpenDDS


## Version 3.6 of OpenDDS

### Notes:
- The discovery framework of OpenDDS has been refactored to be more
  asynchronous.  This should make discovery faster and more reliable
  for both publishing and subscribing clients, regardless of the
  discovery mechanism used (RTPS or InfoRepo).

- DataWriters now release locks more quickly than before. This allows the
  transport to be available to more threads when compared to 3.5.1.

- Improved DDS specification compliance with regards to reliability,
  resource limits, and history qos settings.  Specifically, reliable
  data writers may block for max\_blocking\_time and potentially return
  DDS::RETCODE\_TIMEOUT in situations where they would have simply
  written the data in older version of OpenDDS.  The new behavior
  is required by the DDS specification, see section 2.2.2.4.2.11
  of the version 1.4 specification for details.  This change affects
  various operations of the data writer interface including the
  write and register operations.

### Additions:
- The wireshark dissector now supports wireshark versions 1.8.x, 1.10.x,
  1.12.x, and 1.99.1.

- The modeling framework now support Eclipse 4.4 (Luna) and GMF 3.1.x

- Added a public\_address option for the tcp transport.  This option
  allows a tcp transport instance to listen on one address (local\_address)
  while advertising another address (public\_address) to discovery.
  This feature was used to allow a proxy process between the subscriber
  and publisher in the TcpReconnect test, but may also be useful in
  other deployment scenarios, especially using OpenDDS through a firewall.

### Fixes:
- There were a number of concurrency and thread utilization improvements.
  These changes fixed a number of threading issues as well as improving
  the efficiency of publication.

- Fixed some issues with RTPS discovery.

- Fixed a number of issues related to the reconnect functionality of
  the tcp transport.

- Fixed some bugs in the OpenDDS IPv6 support.

- Eliminate duplicate samples received during durable resend.

- Fixed memory leak at shutdown time in modeling library.

### Tests:
- Many updates to make test results more complete and deterministic.

- Added a TcpReconnect test that exercised the ability of the tcp
  transport to seamlessly reconnect OpenDDS clients when the transport
  layer drops a connection.

- Added a WriteDataContainer unit test to verify data writer memory
  management compliance with the DDS specification.

- Added a PubScalability test that was used to test association and
  publications with large numbers of subscribers.

- Added a packet reassembly unit test.


## Version 3.5.1 of OpenDDS

### Notes:

  - Due to addition control messages in the 3.5.1 release, mixing 3.5.0
  and 3.5.1 releases should work properly, but the 3.5.0 data readers can emit
  the following error message when associating with a durable 3.5.1 data
  writer:
    ERROR: DataReaderImpl::data\_received unexpected message\_id = 11
    Upgrade all endpoints to 3.5.1 to remove this error message.

### Additions:

- Support later (>= 4.7) versions of GCC compilers, and later (>= 2.0a)
  builds of TAO. Configure script now downloads 2.2a by default.

- Added IDL compiler support for typedef of string fields within unions.
  Added Java IDL compiler support for struct forward declarations.

- Updated UML design diagrams to reflect current code base.

### Fixes:

- DCPSInfoRepo no longer informs a subscriber about a crashed or killed
  publisher.  This made associations of current publishers and subscribers
  delayed until timeout was reached.

- Fixed deadlock condition in send\_delayed\_notifications() resulting from
  multiple datawriters.

- Fixed deadlock in DataLinkSet::send\_control().

- Fixed deadlock in WaitSet::wait() and DataReaderImpl::data\_received().

- Fixed multicast transport with multiple participants in a single process.

- Fixed parsing of -ReassociateDelay argument by DCPSInfoRepo.

- Fixed crash of long-lived zero-copy sequence when it is destroyed and
  crash of zero-copy sequence accessing released instances.

- Fixed unprotected access to DataWriterImpl::reader\_info\_,  and
  TransportSendStrategy::pkt\_chain\_.

- Fixed multiple RTPS crashes when participant is being deleted.

- Fixed RTPS crash when a data reader is being deleted.

- Fixed problem for non-unique repo ids for multicast when multiple
  (non-federated) DCPSInfoRepos are used on the same network.

- Fixed crash caused by back-pressure in transport causing the most recent
  sample for an instance to be dropped.

- Fixed error in reconstruction logic for fragmentation of udp and multicast
  transport packets.

- Fixed PublisherImpl and SubscriberImpl to properly set a DataWriterImpl
  or DataReaderImpl entity's deleted flag during deletion to allow
  association checks to properly identify entities that are being deleted and
  not proceed in association.

- Fixed problem for persisted DCPSInfoRepo where persisted participants
  were never dissociating.

- Fixed activity improperly occuring when a partipant is being deleted
  that caused pure virtual function calls. In one case, waiting now takes
  place during deletion of a data writer until all control messages sent during
  unregistration of instances are account for. In another case fixed so
  TransportSendControlElement will delete itself before it reports to the listener
  that the message has been delivered/dropped.

### Tests:

- Many updates to make test results more deterministic.

- Added Reliability test.

- Added ManyToMany test to test associations with additional participants,
  publishers, subcribers, data readers and data writers.

- Added PersistentInfoRepo test.

- Restored thrasher medium and high test cases.

- Rewrite Priority test to make it verify proper QOS functionality.

- Rewrite LargeSample test to make it verify message contents are as expected.


## Version 3.5 of OpenDDS

- Updates to RTPS support resulting from both interoperability
  testing (March 2013 OMG meeting) and user feedback.

- Fixed a bug in the DataReader relating to the Deadline timer.

- Generated TypeSupportImpl classes now contain nested typedefs that
  facilitate programming with C++ templates.
  See tests/DCPS/ManyTopicTest for an example of usage.

- Added config options to bind RTPS-related multicast sockets to
  specific network interfaces.  See the ChangeLog for details.

- Fixed an opendds\_idl code generated bug when typedefs of basic
  types are used as fields of structs.

- Corrected a number of other bugs related to discovery and scaling.


## Version 3.4.1 of OpenDDS

- Added a new option to opendds\_idl, -Wb,v8, which generates type support
  for copying DCPS structs from C++ objects to JavaScript objects -- requires
  the V8 JavaScript engine.  See https://npmjs.org/package/opendds for OpenDDS
  integration with Node.js.

- Fixed a bug in serialization with misaligned reads.  It only impacts
  certain platforms with strict alignment requirements such as SPARC/SunCC.

- Clang 3.2 is now a supported compiler.

- Fixed a bug in the rtps\_udp transport, in certain cases an invalid Gap
  submessage was sent which can result in data samples not being received.


## Version 3.4 of OpenDDS

- Added new OpenDDS-specific APIs for sending and receiving untyped data,
  (does not require code generation from IDL data structures).  See the
  Recorder and Replayer classes and the test in tests/DCPS/RecorderReplayer.

- Implemented the ability to send fragmented data with the rtps\_udp transport.

- Fixed a bug in copy\_from\_topic\_qos(): the Ownership policy is now copied.

- The optimization of publisher-side content filtering now applies to durable
  data in addition to newly written data samples.

- As with versions before 3.2, the DCPSInfoRepo object reference is allowed to
  fail to resolve.  If it fails, the current operation can be re-tried at a
  later time when the DCPSInfoRepo server is available.

- Added a new option for per-domain default transport configurations.

- Corrected IDL string constants for QoS policy names which were wrong in the
  DDS spec (GROUPDATA and TRANSPORTPRIORITY ...\_QOS\_POLICY\_NAME).  These are
  not used anywhere in OpenDDS.


## Version 3.3 of OpenDDS

- If an instance of a transport can't be set up, an exception is thrown so
  that different configuration parameters can be attempted by the user.

- Corrected the mapping of Priority QoS to DiffServ CodePoint DS subfield.

- For thread-per-connection send, if no explicit scheduling policy has been
  configured, OpenDDS will now inherit the current thread's policy/priority.

- Fixed a possible deadlock of RTPS discovery on Windows.

- Added non-blocking I/O setting to tcp sockets, VxWorks 6.4 required it.

- Fixed various bugs in deadline and ownership QoS.

- Improved multicast transport's robustness during handshaking when many
  connections are set up at the same time, and also allow for multicast
  to skip over received datagrams that don't have the expected header values.

- Multicast transport configuration can now specify a local network interface
  which will be used to join the multicast group.

- The support for the generation of the DDS4CCM needed LEM library has been
  moved to CIAO DDS4CCM. This removed the optional dependency on CIAO.


## Version 3.2 of OpenDDS

- Added a new transport type: Shared Memory
  Use shmem as the short name (in place of "tcp", "udp", "multicast", etc.).
  See dds/DCPS/transport/shmem/ShmemInst.h for configurable parameters.

- The udp transport now supports setting IP DSCP (DiffServ CodePoint) based on
  the writer's TRANSPORT\_PRIORITY QoS value.

- Fixed bugs in udp and multicast transports, including reassembly of fragments.

- Made several changes in order to support CIAO 1.1.2 with DDS4CCM. From
  this version DDS4CCM has support for OpenDDS as DDS vendor. Check the CIAO
  release notes for details on what has been ported.

- Added new QOS\_XML library with which QoS settings can be done through an XML
  file. Used at this moment by the CIAO DDS4CCM implementation.

- Implemented rejection of samples due to exceeding max\_instances and
  max\_samples.

- Made the RTPS discovery and transport code more robust.

- Refactored InfoRepo-based discovery into its own library. This reduces the
  dependency on TAO such that certain TAO libraries will no longer be loaded
  unless they are needed for InfoRepo-based discovery.

- For IDL files that only contain local interfaces, the generation of
  server-side TAO code was suppressed. The suppression applies to DdsDcps*.idl.
  This means, for example, that code that was including DdsDcpsSubscriptionS.h
  needs to be changed to include DdsDcpsSubscriptionC.h.

- To reduce library size, OpenDDS can now be conditionally compiled to exclude
  profiles discussed in the Compliance section of the DDS spec. See
  section 1.3.3 in the Developer's Guide for more information.


## Version 3.1 of OpenDDS

- This release includes the initial implementation of DDS Interoperability
  in OpenDDS, using the DDS-RTPS spec v2.1 from the OMG (formal/2010-11-01).

  RTPS support in OpenDDS consists of two main features:

    - A pluggable transport implementation, known as "rtps\_udp" because it
      implements the UDP PSM of the DDS-RTPS spec.  This is a peer of the
      existing OpenDDS-native transports: "tcp", "udp", and "multicast".

    - A new discovery mechanism for RTPS's distributed discovery.  This can
      replace the DCPSInfoRepo in existing OpenDDS deployments.

  Neither of these features is enabled by default.  See the OpenDDS Developer's
  Guide chapter 7 for configuration details.  Also, note that not every OpenDDS
  feature (for example, certain QoS values) is supported with RTPS in the
  initial implementation.  These exceptions are documented in the Developer's
  Guide sections 7.3.3 and 7.4.5.5.

- Changed set\_qos() of DataWriter, DataReader, Publisher and Subscriber so
  when provided a QoS value incompatible with an existing association, that the
  value will be changed, association will be broken, and RETCODE\_OK returned.
  Previously, if any association would be broken, no change would take place
  and false would be returned.  New version is compatible with DDS spec.

- OpenDDS udp transport enhancements:
    - Added send\_buffer\_size and rcv\_buffer\_size parameters to the udp
      transport configuration.
    - The default local address will use DNS host names instead of IP
      addresses.
    - Added support for IPv6 when ACE is built with IPv6 support.

- OpenDDS multicast transport enhancements:
    - Added a configuration parameter "async\_send" (defaults to false)
      that will send multicast datagrams using async I/O if supported
      by the platform.  As of now this is only implemented on Windows.
      It could be extended to Unix aio\_*() functions in theory, but these
      are generally not preferred and the regular socket functions are
      sufficiently fast.

- Removed DataReaderQosExt from DdsDcpsSubscriptionExt.idl.  This was only
  being used to provide a non-standard-compliant backwards-compatibility
  setting to get the DURABILITY QoS behavior matching that of OpenDDS v1.2
  and earlier.  It was not being used in any OpenDDS code.


## Version 3.0.1 of OpenDDS

- The DCPSInfoRepo reassociates Built in Topic connections for existing
  datareaders and datawriters when restarted from persistence.

- The opendds\_idl compiler will now print a warning about not including TAO's
  orb.idl file when a file named orb.idl is included.

- Fixed a bug where the timeout for passive\_connect\_duration was ignored.

- Fixed multiple bugs in fragmentation/reassembly used for udp and multicast.

- Fixed multicast loopback and session re-use problems.

- Fixed a bug with memory management for the TransportCustomizedElement
  used in publisher-side content filtering.

- New example Messenger.minimal - which is like messenger, but streamlined
  for new users to understand the whole easier.


## Version 3.0 of OpenDDS

- Transport configuration has undergone a major redesign and any existing
  transport application code or transport configuration files need to be
  updated.  See the Developer's Guide for details of the design.  See
  $DDS\_ROOT/docs/OpenDDS\_3.0\_Transition.txt for a description on how
  to migrate your applications to the OpenDDS 3.0 design.  As a part of
  this design OpenDDS gains the following capabilities:
    - Most applications can do all transport configuration via
      configuration files (no transport source code required).
    - Individual writers and readers can now support multiple
      transports.

- The simpleTcp transport was renamed to tcp (the directory containing
  its source code was also renamed).

- The udp transport no longer required a local\_address when being
  configured.  If not specified, the property defaults to a value
  selected by the operating system (similar to the tcp transport).

- Details of the OpenDDS Modeling SDK changes in this release are documented
  in the Eclipse-based help, see OpenDDS Modeling SDK Guide -> Getting
  Started -> Introduction to the OpenDDS Modeling SDK.

- First release of OpenDDS Real-Time Data (RTD) for Excel an Excel Add-in
  and RTD Server.  It allows visualization of an operating OpenDDS system
  from within Excel. It gives a tree view of a repository that mirrors the
  stand-alone OpenDDS Monitor application's tree view, but with the
  additional capabilities to automatically restart monitoring of a repository
  when a saved workbook is opened, monitoring multiple repositories
  simultaneously, and snapshot a repository monitor tree view.

- Wireshark dissector improvements include removal of the restriction
  that inforepo IOR be placed in a special file.  Dissector config
  files can now be generated by opendds\_idl.

- The monitor tool has a new view which is an alternate to the Graphviz
  view.  The Node view uses Qt gui elements to model the OpenDDS system.
  Users can manipulate Node view graphs before saving them to PNG files.
