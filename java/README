Starting with release 1.2, OpenDDS provides Java bindings.  Java applications
can make use of the complete OpenDDS middleware just like C++ applications.

See the java/INSTALL file (in this directory) for information on getting
started, including the prerequisites and dependencies.

See the java/FAQ file (in this directory) for information on common issues
encountered while developing with the Java bindings.

* IDL and code generation

OpenDDS is more than just a library that lives in one or two .jar files.  The
DDS specification defines the interaction between a DDS application and the DDS
middleware.  In particular, DDS applications send and receive messages that
are strongly-typed and those types are defined by the application developer in
IDL.  OMG IDL is the interface description language used by both CORBA and DDS.
You can see an example of IDL for DDS in the file Messenger.idl, which can be
found in java/tests/messenger/messenger_idl.

In order for the application to interact with the middleware in terms of these
user-defined types, code must be generated at compile-time based on this IDL.
This will be both C++ and Java code, and even some more IDL.  In most cases,
application developers will not need to be concerned with the details of all
the generated files.  Scripts included with OpenDDS automate this process so
that the developer will end up with a native library (.so or .dll) and a Java
library (.jar or just a "classes" directory) that together contain all of the
generated code.  See the next section ("Step-by-step instructions...") for
details.

Below are "the gory details," a description of the generated files and which
tools generate them.  In this example, Foo.idl contains a single struct "Bar"
contained in module "Baz" (IDL modules are similar to C++ namespaces and Java
packages).  To the right of each file name is the name of the tool that
generates it, followed by some notes on its purpose.

Foo.idl                       - hand-written description of the DDS sample type
- Foo{C,S}.{h,inl,cpp}        - tao_idl: C++ representation of the IDL
- FooTypeSupport.idl          - opendds_idl: DDS-specific code
  - FooTypeSupport{C,S}.{h,inl,cpp}  - tao_idl
  - Baz/BarSeq{Helper,Holder}.java   - idl2jni
  - Baz/BarData{Reader,Writer}*.java - idl2jni
  - Baz/BarTypeSupport*.java  - idl2jni (except TypeSupportImpl, see below)
  - FooTypeSupportJC.{h,cpp}  - idl2jni: JNI native method implementations
- FooTypeSupportImpl.{h,cpp}  - opendds_idl: DDS-specific code
- Baz/BarTypeSupportImpl.java - opendds_idl: DDS-specific code
- Baz/Bar*.java               - idl2jni: Java representation of IDL struct
- FooJC.{h,cpp}               - idl2jni: JNI native method implementations

Foo.idl
-------
module Baz {
#pragma DCPS_DATA_TYPE "Baz::Bar"
  struct Bar {
    long x;
  };
};

* Step-by-step instructions for setting up a new project

These instructions assume you have completed the installation steps in the
java/INSTALL document, including having the various environment variables
defined.

1. Start with an empty directory that will be used for your IDL and the code
   generated from it.  java/tests/messenger/messenger_idl is set up this way.

2. Create an IDL file describing the data structure you will be using with
   OpenDDS.  See Messenger.idl for an example.  This file will contain at least
   one line starting with "#pragma DCPS_DATA_TYPE".  For the sake of these
   instructions, we'll call the file Foo.idl.

3. Create an export header, Foo_Export.h
   Unix    => $ACE_ROOT/bin/generate_export_file.pl Foo > Foo_Export.h
   Windows => %ACE_ROOT%\bin\generate_export_file.pl Foo > Foo_Export.h

4. Create an mpc file, Foo.mpc, from this template:
   --- BEGIN Foo.mpc ---
   project: dcps_java {

     idlflags      += -Wb,stub_export_include=Foo_Export.h \
                      -Wb,stub_export_macro=Foo_Export
     dcps_ts_flags += -Wb,export_macro=Foo_Export
     idl2jniflags  += -Wb,stub_export_include=Foo_Export.h \
                      -Wb,stub_export_macro=Foo_Export
     dynamicflags  += FOO_BUILD_DLL

     specific {
       jarname      = DDS_Foo_types
     }

     TypeSupport_Files {
       Foo.idl
     }
   }
   --- END Foo.mpc ---
   You can leave out the specific {...} block if you don't need to create a jar
   file.  In this case you can directly use the Java .class files which will be
   generated under the "classes" subdirectory of the current directory.

5. Run MPC to generate platform-specific build files.
   Unix    => $ACE_ROOT/bin/mwc.pl -type gnuace
   Windows => %ACE_ROOT%\bin\mwc.pl -type [CompilerType]
                         ** CompilerType options are: vc71, vc8, vc9, and nmake
                            Make sure this is running ActiveState Perl.

6. Compile the generated C++ and Java code
   Unix    => make (GNU make, so this may be "gmake" on Solaris systems)
   Windows => Build the generated .sln (Solution) file using your preferred
     method.  This can be either the Visual Studio IDE or one of the
     command-line tools.  If it's the IDE, start it from a command prompt
     using "devenv" or "vcexpress" (express edition) so that it inherits the
     environment variables.  Command-line tools for building include "vcbuild"
     and invoking the IDE (devenv or vcexpress) with the appropriate arguments.
   When this completes sucesfully you'll have a native library and a Java jar.
   The native library names are as follows:
   Unix => libFoo.so           Windows => Foo.dll (Release) or Food.dll (Debug)
   You can change the locations of these libraries (including the .jar file)
   by adding a line such as the following to the Foo.mpc file:
     libout = $(PROJECT_ROOT)/lib
   where PROJECT_ROOT can be any environment variable defined at build-time.

7. You now have all of the Java and C++ code needed to compile and run a Java
   OpenDDS application.  The generated .jar needs to be added to classpath.
   The generated C++ library needs to be available for loading at runtime:
   Unix    => Add the directory containing libFoo.so to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
   Windows => Add the directory containing Foo.dll (or Food.dll) to the PATH.
              If you are using the debug version (Food.dll) you'll need to
              inform the OpenDDS middleware that it shouldn't look for Foo.dll.
              To do this, add -Dopendds.native.debug=1 to the Java VM arguments.
   See the publisher and subscriber directories in java/tests/messenger for
   examples of publishing and subscribing applications.

8. If you make subsequent changes to Foo.idl, start by re-running MPC (step #5
   above).  This is needed because certain changes to Foo.idl will affect which
   files are generated and need to be compiled.
