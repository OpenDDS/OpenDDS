Starting with release 1.3, OpenDDS provides partial support for JMS 1.1.
Enterprise Java applications can make use of the complete OpenDDS middleware
just like standard Java and C++ applications.

See the INSTALL file in the $DDS_ROOT/java/jms directory (in this directory)
for information on getting started, including the prerequisites and
dependencies.

* Deploying the OpenDDS JMS Provider

Please refer to your application server documentation on how to install and
deploy a new resource adapter.

Some application servers support file based configuration (i.e. JBoss).  For
these servers, example configurations are provided under
$DDS_ROOT/java/jms/example.


======================================================================
* Configuring the OpenDDS JMS Provider

The OpenDDS JMS Provider was designed to be deployed into any Java EE 5
compliant application server.  As such, it relies on a number of standardized
APIs for configuration and deployment.

The OpenDDS JMS Provider uses a combination of JMX and JCA to configure its
components and administered objects.

The following JMX MBeans are provided:

 1. org.opendds.jms.management.ParticipantFactoryService (required)
    This component is responsible for initializing the DomainParticipantFactory
    for use by JMS clients.  Only one instance of this component may be
    configured per process (JVM instance).

    This component supports the following attributes:

      DCPSDebugLevel
      DCPSConfigFile
      DCPSInfoRepo
      DCPSChunks
      DCPSChunkMultiplier
      DCPSLivelinessFactor
      DCPSBit
      DCPSBitTransportIPAddress
      DCPSBitTransportPort
      DCPSBitLookupDurationMsec
      DCPSPendingTimeout
      DCPSPersistentDataDir
      DCPSTransportDebugLevel
      ORBListenEndpoints
      ORBDebugLevel
      ORBLogFile
        The attributes defined above correspond to standard configuration
        options as defined in the DDS and TAO documentation,
        see: $DDS_ROOT/docs

      ORBArgs
        The ORBArgs attribute allows the user to define additional ORB
        arguments manually.  Arguments are separated according to whitespace.

      ORBDirectives
        The ORBDirectives attribute allows the user to define
        ORBSvcConfDirectives manually.  Directives must defined one per line.

      ORBDisableNestedUpcalls
        The ORBDisableNestedUpcalls attribute provides a convenience mechanism
        for disabling upcalls in TAO.  For more information see the OCI
        TAO FAQ.

      TransportType
        The TransportType attribute defines the default DCPS transport type.
        This option is most often defined when using built in topic support.

        The following transport types are supported:
          - SimpleTcp
          - udp
          - multicast


 2. org.opendds.jms.management.Destination (required)
    This component is responsible for initializing Destinations for use by
    JMS clients.  The Destination MBean requires 'destination' and 'type'
    key properties for identification.

    This component supports the following attributes:

      JndiName (required)
        The JNDI name the resulting Destination is bound to.

      DataReaderQosPolicy
        The DDS DataReader QosPolicies used by MessageConsumers for this
        Destination.

      DataWriterQosPolicy
        The DDS DataWriter QosPolicies used by MessageProducers for this
        Destination.

      TopicQosPolicy
        The DDS Topic QosPolicies used by this Destination.


 3. org.opendds.jms.management.HibernatePersistenceService (optional)
    This component is responsible for persisting state in between JMS provider
    shutdowns.  This component is required if durable subscriptions are used
    by JMS client code.

    This component supports the following attributes:

      JndiName (required)
        The JNDI name the resulting PersistenceManager is bound to.

      CacheProviderClass
      CacheRegionPrefix
      CacheUseMinimalPuts
      CacheUseQueryCache
      DataSource
      DefaultSchema
      Dialect
      GenerateStatistics
      Hbm2ddlAuto
      JdbcBatchSize
      JdbcBatchVersionedData
      JdbcFetchSize
      JdbcUseGetGeneratedKeys
      JdbcUseScrollableResultSet
      JdbcUseStreamsForBinary
      MaxFetchDepth
      Password
      QuerySubstitutions
      ShowSql
      UseSqlComments
      Username
        The attributes defined above correspond to standard configuration
        options as defined in the Hibernate documentation.


The following JCA config properties are supported for ConnectionFactories:

  ClientID
    The administratively configured client identifier (used by durable
    subscriptions).

  DomainID (required)
    The DDS domainId Connections created by this ConnectionFactory belong to.

  ParticipantQosPolicy
    The DDS DomainParticipant QosPolicies used by Connections created
    by this ConnectionFactory.

  SubscriberQosPolicy
    The DDS Subscriber QosPolicies used by Connections created by this
    ConnectionFactory.

  SubscriberTransport
    The OpenDDS TransportConfiguration used by the Subscriber.

  PublisherQosPolicy
    The DDS Publisher QosPolicies used by Connections created by this
    ConnectionFactory.

  PublisherTransport
    The OpenDDS TransportConfiguration used by the Publisher.

  TransportType (required)
    See: TransportType attribute in ParticipantFactoryService

  PersistenceManager
    The JNDI name the configured PersistenceManager is bound to.


======================================================================
* Configuring QoS Policies

The various QoS policy attributes/properties follow the java.util.Properties
syntax.  The property names are based on the QoS policy names as defined in
the Supported QoS section of the Platform Independent Module (PIM)
in the DDS specification.

For example:

  PRESENTATION.access_scope=GROUP
  PRESENTATION.coherent_access=true

The following QoS policies are reserved for internal use by the OpenDDS
JMS Provider and may not be used by JMS client code:
  - DURABILITY
  - LIFESPAN
  - PARTITION

The above policies are used internally to configure a number of builtin
JMS provider behaviors.  These QoS policies will be applied based on arguments
passed to the JMS provider, including:
  - JMS message persistence (i.e. DeliveryMode)
  - JMS message time to live (i.e. TTL)
  - JMS noLocal delivery (inhibits messages sent on the same Connection)

For a list of supported QoS policies, please review the OpenDDS documentation.


======================================================================
* Configuring Transports

The various transport configuration attributes/properties also follow the
java.util.Properties syntax.  The property names are based on the JavaBeans
property name of the TransportConfiguration subclasses (i.e.
SimpleTcpConfiguration).

For example:

  swapBytes=false
  maxSamplesPerPacket=8

For a list of supported properties, please review the OpenDDS DCPS
API Specification, see: $DDS_ROOT/java/docs/api


======================================================================
* Native Library Support

Because the OpenDDS JMS Provider relies heavily on JNI to communicate with
OpenDDS, the following restrictions must be observed when deploying the
resource adapter:

  - The resource adapter is not portable between operating systems or
    platforms.  All restrictions defined in $DDS_ROOT/java/README must
    be observed.
  - On Windows platforms, the 'opendds.native.debug' system property should
    be set to 'true' if OpenDDS was built in "debug" mode (native libraries
    have names ending in d.dll).
    Failure to set this system property will result in incorrect library
    loading behavior.
  - Some application servers do not correctly load native libraries packaged
    within resource adapter archives.  If your application server does not
    support this, the resource adapter will attempt to load the libraries
    manually to a temporary directory at startup.
  - To override the default location where native libraries are extracted, you
    may define the 'opendds.native.dir' system property with an alternate path.
    You may also need to add this library path to your environment.


======================================================================
* DCPSInfoRepo Support

Experimental support for running the DCPSInfoRepo as a JMX component within
the JVM is supported with the following restrictions:

  - The DCPSInfoRepoService may not run within the same JVM instance
    as the ParticipantFactoryService.  This means that the DCPSInfoRepo
    cannot be used within the same JVM as JMS client code.
  - DCPSInfoRepo persistence is not supported at this time.

The DCPSInfoRepo may be managed via the DCPSInfoRepoService MBean class
(org.opendds.jms.management.DCPSInfoRepoService).  In addition to the
configuration options provided by the ParticipantFactoryService the
DCPSInfoRepoService also accepts the following attributes:

  BitListenAddress            (corresponds to -a)
  IORFile                     (corresponds to -o)
  NOBITS
  VerboseTransportLogging     (corresponds to -z)
  PersistentFile              (corresponds to PersistenceUpdaterSvc)
  ResurrectFromFile           (corresponds to -r)
  FederatorConfig
  FederationId
  FederateWith

Each of the attributes described above correspond to a DCPSInfoRepo command
line option.  For more information, issue: '$DDS_ROOT/bin/DCPSInfoRepo -?'

It is strongly suggested that if the DCPSInfoRepoService is deployed, a
dedicated server instance should be created which also serves administered
objects (i.e. ConnectionFactory and Destination instances) via JNDI to
eliminate redundancy.


======================================================================
* Known Limitations

As DDS represents only a subset of the functionality exposed by the JMS API,
a number of features remain to be implemented:

- JCA Message Inflow
- JMS Transactions
- JMS Queueing
- Java SE Support (currently requires JCA)
- JMS 1.0 Compatible Interfaces

The above features have not been implemented.  Any attempt to use one of these
features will result in undefined behavior.
