Starting with release 1.3, OpenDDS provides partial support for JMS 1.1.
Enterprise Java applications can make use of the complete OpenDDS middleware
just like standard Java and C++ applications.

See the README.md file in the $DDS_ROOT directory (two levels above here) for a
general overview of OpenDDS.

See the README file in the $DDS_ROOT/java directory (one level above here) for
a general overview of the OpenDDS Java bindings.


======================================================================
* Prerequisites

  See the INSTALL file in the $DDS_ROOT/java directory (one level above here)
  for a list of prerequisites needed to build the OpenDDS JMS Provider.

  In addition to the those mentioned above, the OpenDDS JMS provider also
  requires the following:

  - Apache Ant 1.7.x <http://ant.apache.org/>


======================================================================
* Building the OpenDDS JMS Provider

  1. Build the OpenDDS Java bindings

     For UNIX platforms, the default.features and platform_macros.GNU files
     (see: $DDS_ROOT/java/INSTALL) must be modified to contain the following:
       distrib=1
       versioned_so=0

     NOTE: ACE, TAO, OpenDDS, and the OpenDDS Java bindings must all be built
     with these features to avoid library loading issues.

  2. Build the OpenDDS JMS Provider

     UNIX    => cd $DDS_ROOT/java/jms
                ant all

     Windows => cd %DDS_ROOT%\java\jms
                ant all

     NOTE: This will create a JCA 1.5 compatible RAR (Resource Adapter
     aRchive) under build and run a series of unit tests for verification.


======================================================================
* Next Steps: Deploying the OpenDDS JMS Provider
