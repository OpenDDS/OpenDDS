<body>
    <p>The OpenDDS DCPS JNI API provides a Java&trade; compatible
    interface to the native C++ OpenDDS libraries.</p>

    <p>OpenDDS is an open-source C++ implementation of the
    Object Management Group's specification "Data Distribution
    Service for Real-time Systems". OpenDDS is built on the
    <a href="http://www.theaceorb.com/product/aboutace.html">ACE</a>
    abstraction layer to provide platform portability. OpenDDS also leverages
    capabilities of <a href="http://www.theaceorb.com/">TAO</a> such as its IDL
    compiler and as the basis of the OpenDDS DCPS Information Repository
    (DCPSInfoRepo).</p>

    <p>The primary development of OpenDDS was done by the ACE/TAO development
    team at <a href="http://www.ociweb.com/">Object Computing, Incorporated</a>
    in St. Louis and Phoenix. It is released under the same generous license
    terms as ACE, TAO and MPC.</p>
