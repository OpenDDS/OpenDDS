Starting with release 1.2, OpenDDS provides Java bindings.  Java applications
can make use of the complete OpenDDS middleware just like C++ applications.

See the README.md file in the $DDS_ROOT directory (one level above here) for a
general overview of OpenDDS.


======================================================================
* Prerequisites

  - JDK (Java Development Kit) for Java SE 5 and up

    <http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads>
    Sun distributes the JDK for Windows, Linux, and Solaris.  OpenDDS supports
    these three platforms in both 32-bit and 64-bit variants.  There is also
    experimental support for the 32-bit and 64-bit variants of the JDK provided
    by Apple on macOS.  If you are using a 64-bit JDK, make sure all the
    native libraries are also built for 64-bit.  Similarly, a 32-bit JDK must
    be matched with 32-bit native libraries.

    If using a recent JDK version (9 and higher) that includes the JPMS
    (Java Platform Module System), disable the MPC feature java_pre_jpms.
    The OpenDDS configure script will attempt to detect the Java version and
    set the MPC feature automatically.

  - C++ Compiler

    These instructions assume that you will be using the "native" compiler for
    your chosen platform, namely:
    Windows  => Microsoft Visual C++ <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualc>
    Linux    => GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) <http://gcc.gnu.org>
    Mac OS X => GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) <http://gcc.gnu.org>
    Solaris  => Sun Studio (SunCC) <http://developers.sun.com/sunstudio>

    Other combinations are possible (gcc on Windows, SunCC on Linux, etc.) but
    these have not been tested and will not be covered by this document.

    The following versions are supported:
    - Visual C++ 9 SP1 (part of Visual Studio 2008), Visual C++ 10 SP1 (part of
      Visual Studio 2010), Visual C++ 11 (part of Visual Studio 2012),
      Visual C++ 12 (part of Visual Studio 2013) and Visual C++ 14 (part of
      Visual Studio 2015).

      VC++ 9 and later have free "express editions" -- these will work fine,
      see <http://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/>.

      Note: VC10 (VS2010) and later are supported but there are some issues
      with dependencies and parallel builds.

      When building with VC10 and later, you may need to build twice - the first
      fails, and the second builds successfully.

    - GCC 4.0.x or later (earlier versions may work but haven't been tested)
      Preferably, use the default gcc from your Linux or Mac OS X distribution.
    - Sun Studio 12 (SunCC 5.9) Earlier versions are known to have problems
      with some of the code in the OpenDDS Java bindings.

    On Linux and Solaris, GNU make is also required.  It will almost
    certainly be installed by default on Linux (if not use your
    platform's package management system).  On Solaris be sure that you are
    using GNU make, which may be invoked as "gmake".

    On OS X El Capitan, Yosemite, Mavericks onward, the required build tools
    can be installed by typing the following command from termial.

       xcode-select --install

  - Perl v5.8 or later

    On Unix platforms, perl will be pre-installed or easily installed by the
    platform's package management system.
    On Windows install ActiveState's ActivePerl.  Download it for free from
    <http://www.activestate.com/downloads> -> scroll down to "ActivePerl" and
    click "Get Current Release" -> select the "Download" link.

  - The ACE ORB (TAO), which includes ACE and MPC as subprojects

    OpenDDS requires the use of TAO.  Three "branches" of TAO are supported:

    - OCI TAO 2.2a <http://download.ociweb.com/TAO-2.2a>
    - DOC Group    <http://download.dre.vanderbilt.edu>

    Note: TAO can be automatically downloaded by the configure script, so
    downloading it separately is not strictly necessary.

    From each branch only the current patch release (OCI) or beta/micro release
    (DOC) is supported.  The "current" releases are the latest public releases
    of TAO at the time of the OpenDDS release.  These are listed in the "TAO"
    section of the OpenDDS README.md file (in the parent directory).

    For responsive support from OCI it is recommended that the latest version
    of the OCI release of TAO used for OpenDDS development and testing be used.

    The detailed instructions below are written assuming OCI TAO 2.2a is used.

======================================================================
* Building OpenDDS, including dependencies and Java bindings

  1. Set up the build environment

     Unix    => Any shell should be OK.  Make sure you can run "perl", "make",
                and your C++ compiler (g++ or CC) -- i.e. they are found on
                the PATH.
     Windows => Run the Visual Studio Command Prompt

  2. Extract source code archives

     Unix    => Start with the .tar.gz archives of OpenDDS
     Windows => Start with the .zip archives of OpenDDS

     Extract to the location of your chosing.  On Windows it is simpler to
     use paths with no spaces (true on Unix too but spaces are rarely seen).
     The top level of the OpenDDS distribution is a directory that contains
     the subdirectory named dds.

  3. Configure and build OpenDDS

     Build as in $DDS_ROOT/install, but add --java option

     Unix    => cd $DDS_ROOT
                ./configure --java
                make
     Windows => cd $DDS_ROOT
                configure --java
                Start Visual Studio by executing the generated solution from the command prompt
                Select Build -> Build Solution


  4. Run a test Java application to verify the build

     Note: first set environment via the setenv script.

     Unix    => cd $DDS_ROOT/java/tests/multirepo
                ./run_test.pl
     Windows => cd %DDS_ROOT%\java\tests\multirepo
                run_test.pl
                (for release mode, add -ExeSubDir Release)
