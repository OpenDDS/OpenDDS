usage:  openddsvalidate.sh/.bat
 -f,--file <arg>   .opendds/.codegen file(s) and/or directory(s) contain those files to validate
 -q,--quiet        suppress output except for error reporting
 -r,--recursive    search directory(ies) recursively for opendds files

If there are errors the output will list each error with line and column number, along
with the error message emitted by the schema validation engine.

BUILDING

There are two ant targets for building runnable console/shell applications.

UNIX/LINUX/OSX
Use the ant target dist.nix to build the application for Linux or Unix systems,
inlcuding Mac OS. This results in a archive file openddsvalidate.tar.gz. The
unpack the applacation, use the command tar -zxf openddsvalidate.tar.gz
