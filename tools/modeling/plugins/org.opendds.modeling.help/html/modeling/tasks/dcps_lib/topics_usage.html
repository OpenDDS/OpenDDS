  <h2>Working with Topics</h2>

  <p>A DCPS library should have at least one Topic defined. A Topic
  can be created by selecting topic from the palette.</p>

  <p>A Struct needs to be specified for the Topic's DataType. To
  pick from the allowed Structs, right click on the Topic to bring
  up the context menu. Pick "Select DataType" to bring up a dialog
  showing all the allowable Structs that you can pick from.</p>

  <h3>ContentFilteredTopic</h3>

  <p>A DataReader can optionally connect to a ContentFilteredTopic.
  Each ContentFilteredTopic must be connected to a Topic. Similar
  to a Topic, a ContentFilteredTopic must have a Struct specified
  for its DataType.</p>

  <h3>MultiTopic</h3>

  <p>A DataReader can optionally connect to a MultiTopic. Similar
  to a Topic, a ContentFilteredTopic must have a Struct specified
  for its DataType.</p>
