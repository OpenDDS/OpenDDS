  <h2>Working with OpenDDS Models</h2>

  <h3>The OpenDDS Model</h3>The OpenDDS Model consists of
  "libraries" of possibly re-usable OpenDDS elements and optionally
  Packages that can contain these libraries.

  <div id="note">
    <p>Library in this context is different than the concept of C++
    object file libraries used in OpenDDS. Even though you may be
    working with different modeling libraries the generated code
    will target a single object file library.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Creating a Model</h3>

  <p>To create an OpenDDS SDK model, from the <a href=
  'javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.newWizard")'><b>Eclipse
  File -&gt; New</b></a> -&gt; Other... (Ctrl+N) menu item select
  OpenDDS Diagram under the OpenDDS Models category as shown in the
  figure below.</p><img alt="Creating new OpenDDS diagram" src=
  "../images/new_diagram_selection.png">

  <p>The Create OpenDDS Diagram wizard will prompt for the name of
  the model. This name is used in auto-generated source file names
  and is used as the name of the shared library. It is also used as
  the identifier for a C++ namespace.</p>

  <div id="note">
    <p>If you decide to later change the model name, click on an
    emtpy portion of the main diagram to bring up the name in the
    property sheet in the Properties tab below the diagram.</p>
  </div>

  <p>After selecting a model name the Create OpenDDS Diagram wizard
  will then prompt for the name of the diagram file and the name of
  the file containing domain model itself. It is recommended that
  when specifying these names that you use the default which is the
  name of the model itself.</p>

  <div id="caution">
    <p>Many diagram-based modeling tools keep both the model and
    diagram elements in a single file. In the case of the OpenDDS
    SDK these files are kept separate. Although this will enable
    alternative representations of the model to be considered, care
    should be taken that both the domain model file and diagram
    file are included when sharing OpenDDS models.</p>
  </div><br>

  <h3>Populating the Model</h3>

  <p>After the selection of a new OpenDDS Diagram you will then be
  presented with an editor that consists of a canvas and a palette
  of "libraries" that can dragged onto the canvas. An example of
  this editor is shown in the following figure.</p><img alt=
  "Creating new OpenDDS diagram" src=
  "../images/new_diagram_editor.png">

  <p>You can open a library that is on the canvas by first
  selecting it and then double-clicking on it or pressing the Enter
  key. You can verify it is selected when you see a thick border
  around the figure with re-sizing handles on it as shown
  below.</p><img alt="Selected library" src=
  "../images/main_diagram_selected_lib.png">

  <p>When you open up a library there will be a new editor window
  in your editor window. See <a href=
  "workingwithdiagrams.html#moving_between_diagrams">Moving between
  Diagrams</a> for information on working with multiple diagram
  editors.</p>

  <h3>Using Packages</h3>

  <p>Although you can partition libraries by placing them in
  separate model files, packages provides a way to organize
  libraries within the same model file. Packages can be
  hierarchical and can contain libraries or other
  packages:</p><img alt="Packages" src=
  "../images/main_diagram_packages.png">

  <p>When generating C++ code, packages will map to namespaces.</p>

  <div id="note">
    <p>If you have numerous nested packages you may want to review
    <a href="workingwithdiagrams.html#arranging_figures">arranging
    figures</a> on how to automatically resize and reposition your
    packages and package contents so they don't overlap.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Using Libraries from other Model Files</h3>

  <p>You can make it explicit that you will be using libraries from
  other OpenDDS model files by dragging those libraries from the
  Project Explorer view to the main diagram canvas. These shortcuts
  will have an arrow attached to them indicating they are aliases
  to elements in other files.</p>

  <p>For example, in the figure below, the ReliabilityPolicies
  library from the Policies.opendds file is shown as a shortcut on
  the main diagram. The policies from this library will then be
  available to select from when referencing shared
  policies.</p><img alt="Library shortcut on main diagram" src=
  "../images/main_diagram_lib_shortcut.png">

<div id="note">
<p>Multiple packages (e.g. the four
"Model Policies" shown in the above figure) may be displayed.
This is harmless and any one of the packages can be used.</p><
/div>

  <h3>Validation of Libraries and Packages</h3>

  <p>Before using your model to for code generation you should
  perform validations first. See <a href=
  "performingvalidations.html">Performing Validations</a> to learn
  how to do validations.</p>
