Starting with release 2.1.1, OpenDDS provides support for Wireshark.
The OpenDDS DCPS dissector provides a Wireshark 1.2.x/1.3.x compatible
dissector which supports the TCP/IP, UDP/IP, and IP multicast transports.
Dissection of transport headers and encapsulated sample headers are fully
supported.

======================================================================
* Building the OpenDDS DCPS dissector

These instructions assume you have completed the installation steps in
the $DDS_ROOT/INSTALL document, including having the various environment
variables defined.

In addition, the Wireshark sources must be available and built locally
according to the Wireshark Developer's Guide (see above).

1. Define environment variables

   Linux and Solaris:
     export GLIB_ROOT=<full path to the GLib root directory>
     export WIRESHARK_SRC=<full path to the Wireshark source directory>

   Windows:
     set GLIB_ROOT=<full path to the Wireshark win32-libs/gtk2 directory>
     set WIRESHARK_SRC=<full path to the Wireshark source directory>
     set WIRETAP_VERSION=<version of the wiretap DLL built by Wireshark>

2. Update platform_macros.GNU (optional)

   For Linux and Solaris, the platform_macros.GNU file must be modified
   to contain the following:
     versioned_so=0
     wireshark=1

3. Generate MPC workspace

   Linux and Solaris:
     cd $DDS_ROOT/tools/dissector/
     perl $ACE_ROOT/bin/mwc.pl -type gnuace -features wireshark=1

   Windows:
     cd %DDS_ROOT%\tools\dissector\
     perl %ACE_ROOT%\bin\mwc.pl -type [CompilerType] -features wireshark=1
       "CompilerTypes" tested includes vc71, vc8, vc9, and nmake

4. Build

   Build normally as described in the $DDS_ROOT/INSTALL document.

5. Install plugin

   Linux and Solaris:
     export WIRESHARK_ROOT=<path to the Wireshark installation root directory>
     cp OpenDDS_Dissector.so $WIRESHARK_ROOT/lib/wireshark/plugins/<ws-vers>/

   Windows:
     The default Wireshark install directory is the wireshark-gtk2
     subdirectory of the WIRESHARK_ROOT (top of the source tree).
     copy OpenDDS_Dissector.dll <full path to the Wireshark install>\plugins\<version>\
     -or-
     copy OpenDDS_Dissectord.dll <full path to the Wireshark install>\plugins\<version>\

6. Run Wireshark

   You may verify the plugin is installed correctly by looking at the
   Supported Protocols list.  Depending on the wireshark version, this
   can usually be found somewhere under the Help or Internals menus.
   The OpenDDS_Dissector library we created above should appear in the
   list of plugins or protocols.

   NOTE: You may need to define LD_LIBRARY_PATH (for Linux and Solaris)
         or PATH (for Windows) to resolve dependent libraries when running
         Wireshark once the plugin is installed.


======================================================================
* Available Display Filters

A number of display filters are supported by the OpenDDS DCPS dissector:

1. Transport header display filters

   opendds.version
     Revision of the DCPS protocol.

   opendds.byte_order
     Byte order of transport header contents.

   opendds.length
     Total length of payload, including sample headers.

   opendds.sequence
     Sequence number of transmitted PDU.

   opendds.source
     Source identifier; only used by the multicast transport.

2. Sample header display filters

   opendds.sample.id
     Message ID of sample (i.e. SAMPLE_DATA).

   opendds.sample.sub_id
     Sub-Message ID of sample (i.e. MULTICAST_SYN).

   opendds.sample.flags
     Flags field (see below).

   opendds.sample.flags.byte_order
     Indicates byte order of sample data.

   opendds.sample.flags.coherent
     Indicates sample belongs to a coherent change group.

   opendds.sample.flags.historic
     Indicates sample is historic; resent by DataWriter.

   opendds.sample.flags.lifespan
     Indicates sample defines a lifespan.

   opendds.sample.flags.group_coherent
     Indicates sample uses PRESENTATION.coherent_access.

   opendds.sample.flags.content_filter
     Indicates the publisher has applied filters for Content-Filtered Topics.

   opendds.sample.length
     Total length of sample data, not including sample header.

   opendds.sample.sequence
     Sequence number of transmitted SAMPLE_DATA.

   opendds.sample.timestamp
     Source timestamp of sample.

   opendds.sample.lifespan
     Lifespan duration of sample (iff lifespan flag is set).

   opendds.sample.publication
     Publication ID of transmitting DataWriter.

   opendds.sample.publisher
     ID representing the coherent group (if group_coherent flag is set).

   opendds.sample.content_filter_entries
     Number of entries in this list for filtering (if content_filter flag is set).


======================================================================
* Available Color Filters

A set of color filters are included in the source distribution which may
be imported to highlight DCPS protocol packets.

To import these filters, click on the View -> Coloring Rules menu item,
followed by the the Import button.  Select the colorfilters file in the
$DDS_ROOT/tools/dissector/ directory and click the Open button.

NOTE: Coloring rules are applied on a first match basis; you may need to
      move the imported rules above the "tcp" and "udp" rules using the
      Order buttons on the right-hand side of the dialog.  If ordering is
      changed, you must ensure the "OpenDDS (Important)" rule appears
      before the "OpenDDS" rule.

======================================================================

* Sample Dissectors

Wireshark can be configured to dissect sample data.

1. Export type information using the OpenDDS IDL compiler.  The
   command "opendds_idl -Gitl <filename>.idl" will produce a file
   called <filename>.itl which contains the necessary type
   information.  The new MPC base project "gen_dissector" may be used
   in MPC to add -Gitl to the opendds_idl command line.

2. Start wireshark in the directory containing the itl file or set the
   OPENDDS_DISSECTORS environment variable to the directory containing
   the itl file.  The OpenDDS Wireshark plugin will try to load all
   .itl files in either OPENDDS_DISSECTORS if specified or the current
   directory.

Type information is exported using Intermediate Type Language (ITL).
For more information, see <http://github.com/objectcomputing/itl>.

======================================================================
* Known Limitations

  - OpenDDS only maintains wire compatibility with the current revision
    of the DCPS protocol.  This dissector is effective for the compiled
    protocol version only.
