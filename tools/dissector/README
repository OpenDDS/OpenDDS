The OpenDDS DCPS Wireshark dissector supports the TCP/IP, UDP/IP, and IP
multicast transports. Dissection of transport headers and encapsulated sample
headers are fully supported. Optional dissection of sample payloads is also
supported from Wireshark 1.12 on. The dissector is compatible with Wireshark
1.2 up to at least 2.4 and has been tested with Windows, macOS, and Linux.

======================================================================
* Building the OpenDDS DCPS dissector

Follow the steps in the INSTALL file in the root of OpenDDS directory, along
with the steps here.

In addition, the Wireshark sources must be available and built locally
according to the Wireshark Developer's Guide (see above) or the headers and
libraries must be installed through a development package like:
 - "wireshark-devel" on Fedora derived Linux distributions.
 - "wireshark-dev" on Debian derived Linux distributions.

1. Set up the Build System to Build the Dissector

   There are two ways to build against Wireshark depending on how Wireshark
   was built or was acquired:

    - The older method, "--wireshark" passed with the location of the
      Wireshark headers and libraries. This should be used with:

       - Any version of Wireshark built with autoconf, which is try if you
         ran autogen.sh. This is the recommended way to build on Linux as
         of Wireshark 2.4.

       - Wireshark 1.x built on Windows. Also %WIRETAP_VERSION% should also
         be set to the version of wiretap in the build.

       - If there is a development package available for your system
         and you want to use it to avoid having to build Wireshark.
         This option defaults to /usr/include/wireshark if it exists, so
         supplying the path isn't necessary.

    - The newer out-of-source method, "--wireshark_cmake", should be used if
      Wireshark was built using CMake, which can put "config.h" header and
      the Wireshark libraries somewhere other than the source tree. This is
      Wireshark's recommended method for Windows and macOS and can optionally
      be used on Linux. This method has two more parameters:

       --wireshark_build
         Is the build directory the user choose before building Wireshark.
         This is required and an absolute path.

       --wireshark_lib
         Is the location of the Wireshark libraries RELATIVE to the build
         location. It's optional but it might have to be supplied depending
         on the version of Wireshark as these defaults are based on
         Wireshark 2.4:
           - On Windows the default is "run\RelWithDebInfo".
           - On macOS the default is "run/Wireshark.app/Contents/Frameworks".
           - On Linux the default is "" (They are in the build directory).

   Glib is also required to build the dissector, so "--glib" must be passed.
   If Wireshark was not built with the system Glib or Glib is not installed,
   the install prefix of Glib must be passed as well:
    - On Windows this will be something like: wireshark-win(32|64)-libs-*\gtk2
    - On macOS it depends on if the built-in dependency script or a package
      manager like Homebrew was used to install Wireshark's dependencies.
    - On the average Linux, it shouldn't be necessary unless you needed to use
      a Glib that is not installed to build Wireshark.

   For optional sample payload dissection support, RapidJSON must be available
   and "--rapidjson" must be passed. It might already be available if OpenDDS
   was recursively cloned by a git client or RapidJSON is installed in a
   default include location (RapidJSON is header only library).
   If RapidJSON is not installed on the system, it must be downloaded using:
     git submodule update --init --recursive
   or equivalent for your git client or manually downloading and placing the
   library at DDS_ROOT/tools/IntermediateTypeLang/cpp/rapidjson.

2. Build

   Build normally as described in the $DDS_ROOT/INSTALL document.

3. Install Plugin

   To install the dissector plugin, copy the plugin file  from
   DDS_ROOT/tools/dissector to one of the plugin directories listed in the
   Folders section in Wireshark's About Dialog which can be found in the Help
   menu. On Windows, the plugin file will be named OpenDDS_Dissector.dll or
   OpenDDS_Dissectord.dll. On UNIX-like systems it will be named
   OpenDDS_Dissector.so.

   See <https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChPluginFolders.html>
   for details on where Wireshark looks for plugins.

4. Run Wireshark

   setenv.sh or setenv.cmd must be sourced before running Wireshark or
   it will complain that it couldn't load the dissector if the OpenDDS
   libraries are not installed system-wide.

   You may verify the plugin is installed correctly by looking at the
   Supported Protocols list.  Depending on the Wireshark version, this
   can usually be found somewhere under the Help or Internals menus.
   The OpenDDS_Dissector library we created above should appear in the
   list of plugins or protocols.

======================================================================
* Environment Variables

   OPENDDS_DISSECTORS
     If set the dissector will look for ITL files in that location
     to use for sample payload dissection.

   There are two environment variables the dissector will use for debugging:

   OPENDDS_DISSECTOR_LOG
     If set, the dissector will write log output to
     OpenDDS_wireshark.log in the current directory.

   OPENDDS_DISSECTOR_SIGSEGV
     If set, the dissector will not handle segfaults when they occur
     during sample payload dissection. If not set, a segfault will
     cause a dialog to appear to suggest that the ITL file is wrong
     and close Wireshark. Setting this might be more helpful if
     using a debugger to see where the segfault occurred.

======================================================================
* Available Display Filters

A number of display filters are supported by the OpenDDS DCPS dissector:

1. Transport header display filters

   opendds.version
     Revision of the DCPS protocol.

   opendds.byte_order
     Byte order of transport header contents.

   opendds.length
     Total length of payload, including sample headers.

   opendds.sequence
     Sequence number of transmitted PDU.

   opendds.source
     Source identifier; only used by the multicast transport.

2. Sample header display filters

   opendds.sample.id
     Message ID of sample (i.e. SAMPLE_DATA).

   opendds.sample.sub_id
     Sub-Message ID of sample (i.e. MULTICAST_SYN).

   opendds.sample.flags
     Flags field (see below).

   opendds.sample.flags.byte_order
     Indicates byte order of sample data.

   opendds.sample.flags.coherent
     Indicates sample belongs to a coherent change group.

   opendds.sample.flags.historic
     Indicates sample is historic; resent by DataWriter.

   opendds.sample.flags.lifespan
     Indicates sample defines a lifespan.

   opendds.sample.flags.group_coherent
     Indicates sample uses PRESENTATION.coherent_access.

   opendds.sample.flags.content_filter
     Indicates the publisher has applied filters for Content-Filtered Topics.

   opendds.sample.length
     Total length of sample data, not including sample header.

   opendds.sample.sequence
     Sequence number of transmitted SAMPLE_DATA.

   opendds.sample.timestamp
     Source timestamp of sample.

   opendds.sample.lifespan
     Lifespan duration of sample (iff lifespan flag is set).

   opendds.sample.publication
     Publication ID of transmitting DataWriter.

   opendds.sample.publisher
     ID representing the coherent group (if group_coherent flag is set).

   opendds.sample.content_filter_entries
     Number of entries in this list for filtering (if content_filter flag is set).

  See below for Filtering based on the sample payload.

======================================================================
* Available Color Filters

A set of color filters are included in the source distribution which may
be imported to highlight DCPS protocol packets.

To import these filters, click on the View -> Coloring Rules menu item,
followed by the Import button.  Select the colorfilters file in the
$DDS_ROOT/tools/dissector/ directory and click the Open button.

NOTE: Coloring rules are applied on a first match basis; you may need to
      move the imported rules above the "tcp" and "udp" rules using the
      Order buttons on the right-hand side of the dialog.  If ordering is
      changed, you must ensure the "OpenDDS (Important)" rule appears
      before the "OpenDDS" rule.

======================================================================

* Sample Dissection

The dissector, when configured with RapidJSON, can dissect sample data on
Wireshark 1.12 and later. To use this:

1. Export type information using the OpenDDS IDL compiler.  The
   command "opendds_idl -Gitl <filename>.idl" will produce a file
   called <filename>.itl which contains the necessary type
   information.  The new MPC base project "gen_dissector" may be used
   in MPC to add -Gitl to the opendds_idl command line.

2. Start wireshark in the directory containing the itl file or set the
   OPENDDS_DISSECTORS environment variable to the directory containing
   the itl file.  The OpenDDS Wireshark plugin will try to load all
   .itl files in either OPENDDS_DISSECTORS if specified or the current
   directory.

Type information is exported using Intermediate Type Language (ITL).
For more information, see
  <https://github.com/objectcomputing/OpenDDS/tree/master/tools/IntermediateTypeLang>.

======================================================================

* Sample Dissection Filtering

When the dissector can dissect sample data, it also allows Wireshark to filter
OpenDDS packets based on contents.

The base of this filter namespace is "opendds.sample.payload".
If the type "Messenger::Message" is being used by OpenDDS and the ITL
file is located in OPENDDS_DISSECTORS (or the directory Wireshark was started
in), then packets that carry this can be filtered by
"opendds.sample.payload.Messenger.Message". Further more packets can be
filtered by the data in the payload, for example:

  opendds.sample.payload.Messenger.Message.subject contains "DDS"
  opendds.sample.payload.Messenger.Message.count >= 4

See <https://wiki.wireshark.org/DisplayFilters> and
<https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/wireshark-filter.html>
for examples of how Wireshark display filters can be used.

Notes:

  - IDL Arrays and Sequences value is the number of elements:

      opendds.sample.payload.Messenger.Message.seq < 3

      This will show all OpenDDS packets with a payload of type
      "Messenger::Message" where it's "seq" member has less than 3 elements.

    To filter the items inside use "_e" (element). Items can not be
    filtered by index of the elements:

      opendds.sample.payload.Messenger.Message.seq._e.some_value == 1

  - Values of Enums are represented by string names of the members. So if a
    Enum has a member "Invalid", then you can filter for packets with that
    value with:

      opendds.sample.payload.Messenger.Message.enum == "Invalid"

  - Union members are accessible by their name, not by their discriminator
    value. If packets have a Union u on a boolean member u_b that is true,
    then they can be found with:

      opendds.sample.payload.Messenger.Message.u.u_b == 1

  - Long Doubles are cast down to doubles.

  - Wide strings and wide characters are converted from UTF-16 to UTF-8 using
    iconv. Data that is invalid UTF-16 is replaced by a message saying that
    it was invalid and what kind of problem iconv had with it.

  - To retain compatibility with Wireshark 1.12, OpenDDS/IDL Chars are given
    to Wireshark as strings and must be filtered as such. This means that when
    filtering they must be typed with double quotes (") like a C string
    literal, not single quotes (') like a C character literal. The same
    applies to WChars, but that's because Wireshark does not have a dedicated
    wide character type.

======================================================================
* Known Limitations

  - OpenDDS only maintains wire compatibility with the current revision
    of the DCPS protocol.  This dissector is effective for the compiled
    protocol version only.

  - The sample dissector can not distinguish between two IDL types that
    have the same name. When using an ITL file that does not match
    what OpenDDS is using, the dissector will do one of following:
      - Cause Wireshark to crash, but a pop up window informs the user of the
        probable cause.
      - Mark the OpenDDS packet as malformed, which will be colored red.
      - Fill the sample payload fields with incorrect data, or omit fields
        entirely.
