OpenDDS is an open-source C\++ implementation of the Object Management Group's
specification "Data Distribution Service for Real-time Systems".  Although
OpenDDS is itself developed in C++, Java and JMS bindings are provided so
that Java applications can use OpenDDS.

OpenDDS is built on the [ACE](http://www.theaceorb.com/product/aboutace.html)
abstraction layer to provide platform portability.  OpenDDS also leverages
capabilities of [TAO](http://www.theaceorb.com/), such as its IDL compiler
and as the basis of the OpenDDS DCPS Information Repository (DCPSInfoRepo).

The primary development of OpenDDS was done by
[Object Computing, Incorporated](http://www.objectcomputing.com) in
St. Louis and Phoenix.  It is released under the same generous license
terms as ACE, TAO and MPC.  See the LICENSE file for details.

# Features

This release of OpenDDS is based on the DDS Specification [formal/2015-04-10
(version 1.4)](http://www.omg.org/spec/DDS/1.4).  It features the following
transport protocols:

* TCP/IP
* UDP/IP
* IP multicast
* RTPS over UDP/IP (unicast and multicast)

RTPS (Interoperability) features are based on the [DDS-RTPS Specification
formal/2014-09-01 (version 2.2)](http://www.omg.org/spec/DDSI-RTPS/2.2).  See
the OpenDDS Developer's Guide and the file docs/design/RTPS for more details on
RTPS.

See the [Developer's Guide](http://download.objectcomputing.com/OpenDDS) for
information on OpenDDS compliance with the DDS specification. If you would like
to contribute a feature or sponsor the developers to add a feature  please see
the Support section above for contact information.


# Dependencies

## TAO

OpenDDS requires TAO for both IDL compilation as well as interaction
with the DCPSInfoRepo.  If you will be using the "configure" script for OpenDDS
(see the INSTALL file for details), you do not need to download TAO first --
the "configure" script will download it for you.

Use one of the following versions when building OpenDDS:

* TAO 2.2a patch 12
* TAO 2.4.4 (DOC Group)

Note that the 2.2a release is from OCI and can be obtained
from http://www.theaceorb.com/.  The DOC Group releases can be obtained from
http://download.dre.vanderbilt.edu/.

## GNU Make

GNU Make 3.80+ was used for automating the compiling and linking of OpenDDS
on Unix and Linux systems.

## Perl

Perl is used for running the automated tests and examples included in this
source tree and generating Makefiles or Visual Studio project files.  On Windows
we recommend the use of ActiveState Perl.  The configure script also uses Perl.
