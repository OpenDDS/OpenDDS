<h1>Domain and Repository Configuration Settings</h1>
<hr>

<p>
With the ability to attach a process to more than a single DCPSInfoRepo
repository object, repository information and the associations between
domains and the repository that contains the information for a given
domain become more complex.  Each repository needs to be made known to
the application, and each domain must be associated with a specific
repository.  DCPSInfoRepo objects provide DDS service information to
application Service_Participant objects for one or more DDS domains.
</p>

<p>
The repository information and domain associations can be configured for
the DDS service using the command line, a configuration file, or the API.
The previously used defaults, command line arguments and configuration
file settings will work as is for existing applications that do not
want to take advantage of the new capability.  The repository default
or a repository specified on the command line or in the common section
of the configuration file is used as the default repository.
</p>

<p>
Each repository that will be attached to an application must be
specified.  This can be done via command line, configuration file, or
using the API.  In all cases the information that must be specified is
the IOR for the repository, and a unique key for that repository within
the given process.
</p>

<p>
Each domain that will be used for communication within a process must be
associated with a single repository that contains all information about
that specific domain.  Any given repository may contain information on
more than one domain, but a domain may be associated with only a single
repository.  This association is made by specifying it either in a
configuration file or using the API.  No command line option exists to
specify the association between a domain and a repository.
</p>

<p>
A default repository is used when no specific information is given about
a repository or no specific association has been made between a domain
and a repository.  This means that if no repository or domain information
is specified at all in the application, then the default repository IOR
of "file://repo.ior" will be used as the stringified IOR value for the
repository used by all domains within the process.
</p>

<p>
If a single repository is specified on the command line or using the
configuration file [common] section key <strong>DCPSInfoRepo</strong>,
then that will be used as the default repository for all domains which
are not explicitly bound to a different repository.  If a domain is not
explicitly associated with a repository, it will be associated with the
default repository.
</p>

<p>
The API support for configuring repositories and associations of domains
to repositories is provided by the Service_Participant methods
<code>set_repo_ior(&quot;IOR&quot;, repo_key)</code> and
<code>set_repo_domain( domain, repo_key)</code> where
<code>&quot;IOR&quot;</code> is
the repository IOR or its location, <code>repo_key</code> is a unique key value for
that repository within the application and <code>domain</code> is a DDS domain to be
associated with a specific repository.
</p>

<p>
Configuration file specification for repository and domain associations
with repositories are contained in individual [repository] and [domain]
subsections within the configuration file.  Each repository being
specified should reside in its own subsection.  The subsection name is
arbitrary and can be used to document the use or intent of the repository
being specified.  Each domain being associated with a repository within a
configuration file should reside in its own subsection.  This subsection
name is also arbitrary and can be used for documentation purposes.
</p>

<p>
Subsections are specified using a slash separated path syntax, similar
to directory paths used on Unix systems and their derivatives.
A repository subsection should be on a path with the format
<strong>[repository/&lt;NAME&gt;]</strong> where the &quot;repository/&quot;
is literal and the &quot;&lt;NAME&gt;&quot; is to be replaced by a unique
subsection name.  similarly a domain subsection would be specified as
<strong>[domain/&lt;NAME&gt;]</strong>.  There may be any number of repository
or domain sections within a single configuration file.
</p>

<p>
Repository subsections require 2, and only 2, key/value pairs to be
specified within each subsection.  The keys to specify values for
are <strong>RepositoryIor</strong> and <strong>RepositoryKey</strong>.
The <strong>RepositoryKey</strong> values must be unique for each
repository within the entire configuration file.  They also must not be
reused for a different repository through the use of the API.
</p>

<p>
While <strong>RepositoryKey</strong> values must be unique within a given
process, there are no constraints on the value between processes.  That
is there is no requirement that key values be consistent or the same in
different processes for specifying a particular repository.
</p>

<p>
Domain subsections require 2, and only 2, key/value pairs to be
specified within each subsection.  The keys to specify values for
are <strong>DomainId</strong> and <strong>DomainRepoKey</strong>.  The
<strong>DomainRepoKey</strong> values may be specified either in the
configuration file or later through the API, but must have been specified
before a DomainParticipant for the domain is created.  The special value
<strong>DEFAULT_REPO</strong> can be used to associate a domain with the
default repository explicitly.
If more than one subsection specifies an association between a single
domain and different repositories, only the last (in the file) association
will be honored.

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>
This example defines a single repository to be used for all domains within
the application.
<pre>

[common]
DCPSInfoRepo = file://repo3.ior

</pre>
</p>

<hr>
<p>
This example defines a default repository and explicitly associates two
domains with it.  Note that the [domain] subsections are redundant in
this example, since they would be associated with the default repository
by default.  These sections can be considered as documentation in this
case.
<pre>

[common]
DCPSInfoRepo = file://repo1.ior

[domain/Subscriber]
DomainId = 411
DomainRepoKey = DEFAULT_REPO

[domain/Publisher]
DomainId = 511
DomainRepoKey = DEFAULT_REPO

</pre>
</p>

<hr>
<p>
This example defines a single repository (not the default) and associates
two domains with it.  Note that other domains will be associated with the
default repository, which in the absence of a command line or API
specification of the default will be the default IOR of
&quot;file://repo.ior&quot;.
<pre>

[repository/local]
RepositoryKey = 311
RepositoryIor = file://repo2.ior

[domain/Subscriber]
DomainId      = 711
DomainRepoKey = 311

[domain/Publisher]
DomainId      = 811
DomainRepoKey = 311

</pre>
</p>

<hr>
<p>
This example defines three different repositories and associates six
domains with them.  Note how the repository key values are used to
do this.
<pre>

[repository/Top]
RepositoryKey = 0
RepositoryIor = file://repo1.ior

[repository/Middle]
RepositoryKey = 1
RepositoryIor = file://repo2.ior

[repository/Bottom]
RepositoryKey = 2
RepositoryIor = file://repo3.ior

[domain/Band]
DomainId      = 311
DomainRepoKey = 0

[domain/Information]
DomainId      = 411
DomainRepoKey = 0

[domain/Vmx]
DomainId      = 611
DomainRepoKey = 1

[domain/QuickieMart]
DomainId      = 711
DomainRepoKey = 1

[domain/Warnings]
DomainId      = 811
DomainRepoKey = 1

[domain/Emergencies]
DomainId      = 911
DomainRepoKey = 2
