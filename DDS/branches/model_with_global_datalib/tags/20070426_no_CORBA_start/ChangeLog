        * bin/DCPS/HTemplate.pm:

          Method declarations within the class definition should not have the
          class's scope resolution prepended.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkCleanupTask.h:

          Added an export macro on this class.  Thanks to Wallace Zhang for
          reporting this one.

          Fixed bug in transport and DCPS layer that remove_association()
          removes all assoications related to the remote id provided by
          the DCPSInfoRepo. It should just remove the association of
          the remote id and local id and the link only used by them.

        * bin/dcps_tests.lst:

        * dds/DCPS/DomainParticipantImpl.cpp:

          Rolled back the work around.

Tue Apr 24 18:41:35 UTC 2007 Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DomainParticipantImpl.cpp:

          Added 2 seconds delay after participant creates the built-in-topic
          datareaders. This is a work around for the problem of the
          built-in-topic data lost during fully association period. We need
          find a better solution to synchronize the bit data publishing and
          subscribering.

Thu Apr 19 20:22:30 UTC 2007 Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.cpp:

          Rolled back part of changes in last commit - moved
          the send() call inside the lock since it could cause
          deadlock situation when there are multiple datawriters with
          multiple writing threads in a process. The deadlock situation
          happens when first writing thread calls send_start(), second
          writing thread calls send_start(), first writing thread calls
          send_stop() which hold the lock in DataLinkSet and calls second
          datawriter data_delivered(), the second datawriter holds its
          writer's lock and stuck on acquiring the lock in DataLinkSet.

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.cpp:

          Moved the send() call outside the lock since the
          TransportInterface::send() is thread safe and
          added another parameter to data_available() to avoid
          duplicate code of resend_data_available() from
          data_available().

           since it could hanppen.

        *  dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfoRepo.cpp:

          Made poa_manager activate() called before initialize bit.
          Otherwise a TRANSIENT exception will be caught.

        *  dds/InfoRepo/DCPS_IR_Domain.cpp:

          Made the built-in-topic datawriter use the
          TRANSIENT_LOCAL_DURABILITY_QOS instead of using the
          TransientKludge. However, the TransientKludge is still
          be used for other purpose such as using that so the
          domainparticipant in DCPSInfoRepo will not create the
          bit datareader. We may need rename it.

        *  dds/DCPS/DataSampleList.cpp:
        *  dds/DCPS/DataSampleList.inl:
        *  dds/DCPS/DataSampleList.h:

          Made the next_send_sample_/previous_send_sample link isolated
          from the next_sample_/previous_sample link. When
          inserting/deleting DataSampleElement to one of the links will
          not change the other link.
          Added sub list to the DataSampleElement to support the
          transient local qos. The DataSampleElement defaults to have
          0 subs which means it will be sent to all datalinks
          otherwise it will be sent to the specified subscribers.

        *  dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.h:
        *  dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:

          - Added bit flag.
          - Added RepoId->InstanceHandler map to cache the info retrieved
            upon add_association any operation after will look the cache
            to get the instance handler such as for listener callback. This
            will solve the problem that remove_association will fail look
            up the bit information.
          - Fixed a bug that does not synchronize the reference counting
            on datareader servant. This causes access violation on TCPListener
            test sometimes.

        *  dds/DCPS/WriteDataContainer.cpp:
        *  dds/DCPS/WriteDataContainer.h:

          - Made all internal list(unsent, sending, released, sent) using
            next_send_sample/previous_send_sample link, instance sample list
            and waiting instance sample list using next_instance_sample link
            and added the sample_holder which uses next_sample/previous sample
            link to hold all samples by the order of write.
          - Supported reenqueue_all to specified subscribers.

        *  dds/DCPS/transport/simpleUnreliableDgram/SimpleMcastTransport.cpp:

           Corrected the class name in a debug message.

        *  dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.h:
        *  dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSetMap.h:

        *  dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSet.cpp:
        *  dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.cpp:

           - Supported the samples to send to specific datareaders
           - Fixed a problem that the publisher fully association expect the
             same repo set received as in pending association set. This will
             fail when the subscriber creates multiple datareaders to the
             same topic. The pending association set should be a subset of the
             fully association info from subscriber instead of exact same.

        *  dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportFactory.h:
        *  dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportFactory.cpp:

          Made the TransportFactory create a new reactor for different
          transport instance. With a single reactor thread, the input of
          one transport will be blocked while another transport is handling
          input. This would solve the problem that lookup instance handle
          by repo id fail via built-in-topic datareader during
          fully_association.

        *  dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:
        *  dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.h:

          - Supported TRANSIENT_LOCAL_QOS on datawriter. The datawriter
            will resend all current sending and sent samples to the new
            associated datareaders.
          - Added RepoId->InstanceHandler map to cache the info retrieved
            upon add_association any operation after will look the cache
            to get the instance handler such as for listener callback. This
            will solve the problem that remove_association will fail look
            up the bit information.

        *  dds/DCPS/BuiltInTopicUtils.h:

           Changed the fail return to RETCODE_ERROR.

        *  dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.cpp:
        *  dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.h:

           Made the built-in-topic defaults be on and removed the set_BIT().
           Supported -DCPSBit option in command line and also in DCPS config.
           The commandline option will overwrite the DCPS configuration.

        *  dds/DCPS/Qos_Helper.inl:
        *  dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.h:
        *  dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.cpp:

           Supported TRANSIENT_LOCAL_QOS.

        *  dds/DCPS/SubscriberImpl.cpp:

          Fixed a deadlock situation that the reactor thread and the
          thread calling delete_participant acquire locks in reverse
          order. The two involved locks are the si_lock_ in SubscriberImpl
          and the token_ in ACE_Select_Reactor_T. The thread calling
          delete_participant holds the lock in SubscriberImpl and tries
          to acquire lock in select reactor to remove handler while the
          reactor thread is handling an event which holds the lock in reactor.
          The reactor thread delieved the sample to datareader and insert
          the datareader to the subscriber internal cotainer which acquire
          the lock in SubscriberImpl. Since the lock in SubscriberImpl protects
          the internal data structure, to fix this problem, the lock scope
          in SubscriberImpl was adjusted so that the datareader will not hold
          the lock while calling remove_all_associations().


        *  dds/DdsDcpsInfrastructure.idl:

          Updated the DCPS_DATA_KEY definition for built-in-topic so it can
          generate appropriate KeyLessThan method.

          Configured the tests either run with the bit on or
          off.
          - All performance tests defaults to run with non-bit.
            The TCPListenerTest has option to run with bit.
            e.g. run "run_test-1p4s.pl bit"
          - Some tests that the bit is not applicable.
            e.g. FooTest3_0, FooTest3_1 and FooTest3_2
          - The new tests are run with non-bit.
            e.g. tests/Messenger_Imr/run_test.pl
                 tests/DCPS/Messenger_ZeroCopy/run_test.pl
                 tests/DCPS/Prst_delayed_subscriber/run_test.pl
          - The UDP and Mcast test case does not run with bit.

          Disabled the reenqueue_all test since it is not applicable.
          The condition of reenqueue_all() call is changed from based
          on TransientKludge to based on TRANSIENT_LOCAL qos and
          resend the samples in queue to the new associated datareader
          instead of all subscribered datareaders.

          Templatize the data structures. Allows for reusability.

        * dds/InfoRepo/UpdateManager.h:
        * dds/InfoRepo/UpdateManager.cpp:
          Added interfaces for upstream communication.

        * dds/InfoRepo/Updater.h:
        * dds/InfoRepo/Updater.cpp:
          Add cpp file. This got rid of a circular include dependency.

        * tests/DCPS/Serializer/SerializerTest.cpp:

          Changed some long double assignments, passed as an array
          of chars, for platforms where the size of the long
          double is less than 16 bytes, to use signed chars
          (7 bits) for all array values, where in each case
          half the previous values were using all 8 bits. This
          change eliminates warnings on platforms/compilers
          where char is a signed type, for example Windows/vc8.

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest4_0/Reader.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/FooTest4/Writer.cpp:

          Added explicit casts to eliminate truncation warnings
          in assignments of time_t to signed 32-bit integer types.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/ReliableMulticast/ReliableMulticast.mpc:

          Added vc8_warnings.mpb as a base project to eliminate
          a vc8 warning about the parameters passed to std::copy.

Tue Mar 27 14:25:40 UTC 2007  Ciju John  <johnc@ociweb.com>

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfoRepo.cpp:
          Move variable initialization into the constructor.

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfo_i.h:
        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfo_i.cpp:
          The InfoRepo holds a reference to the UpdateManager. The
          UpdateManager is the gateway for all persistence and federation
          services.

        * dds/InfoRepo/Updater.h:
        * dds/InfoRepo/Updater.inl:
          Interfaces for the persistence/federation services.

        * dds/InfoRepo/PersistenceUpdater.h:
        * dds/InfoRepo/PersistenceUpdater.cpp:
          Concrete persistence implementation.

        * dds/InfoRepo/UpdateDataTypes.h:
          Data types common to all updates.

        * dds/InfoRepo/UpdateManager.h:
        * dds/InfoRepo/UpdateManager.cpp:
          This is a service object that acts as the gateway coordinating
          the InfoRepo, persistence & federation services.

          Add some known problems to the release notes.

Mon Mar 26 16:05:36 UTC 2007  Pan Dan  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:

          Fixed a bug on registration sample marbling when data type has
          unbounded size and registers with variable size data. The problem is
          the serialization buffer does not allocate enough memory for the
          registered sample.

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Added the bug fix to release note.

Fri Mar 23 15:13:43 UTC 2007  Ciju John  <johnc@ociweb.com>

        * dds/InfoRepo/UpdateManager.h:
        * dds/InfoRepo/UpdateManager.cpp:
        * dds/InfoRepo/Update_export.h:
          Framework for dealing with Persistence and federation menagers.

Wed Mar 21 18:06:01 UTC 2007  Jeff Parsons <j.parsons@vanderbilt.edu>

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfoRepo.cpp:

          Changed return value of an ACE_ERROR_RETURN macro
          to eliminate an int-to-bool warning on VC8.

        * dds/DCPS/Qos_Helper.inl:

          Changes to eliminate time_t-to-CORBA::Long conversion
          warnings on VC8.

        * tests/DCPS/BuiltInTopic/main.cpp:
          Remove empty line.

        * tests/DCPS/Messenger_Imr/run_test.pl:
          No need for a timed kill. A timed kill produces an error message
          which threw havoc on the nightly test run.

Tue Mar 20 13:51:51 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

Mon Mar 19 19:14:34 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * bin/auto_run_tests.pl:

          When running an executable directly (no run_test.pl), we need to take
          into account the -ExeSubDir setting.

Mon Mar 19 14:48:21 UTC 2007  Ciju John  <johnc@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/Messenger_Imr/pub.ini:

        * DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/run_ns_test.pl:

          The nsadd binary needs to be found in $ACE_ROOT/bin.  The fact that
          it's also in $TAO_ROOT/utils/nslist is just a side-effect of the GNU
          make build system.

        * tests/DCPS/Messenger_ZeroCopy/run_corbaloc_test.pl:
        * tests/DCPS/Messenger_ZeroCopy/run_ns_test.pl:

          Renamed this file from Messenger.mpc to Messenger_ZeroCopy.mpc since

          Added the -l command-line option, used to specify an alternate file
          containing the test list.
          When using the -s option (sandbox), don't assume that the target test
          is a Perl script, it may be an executable.  Files ending in .pl are
          assumed to be Perl scripts, otherwise they will be treated as
          executables.
          Also, removed code specific to ACE tests.

          Added a reliable multicast transport from the ReliableMulticast
          branch, merging revisions 450 through 528 from that branch into
          the trunk.  This transport has the same basic configuration
          parameters as the unreliable multicast transport, but adds the
          following:

            sender_history_size - How many packets to buffer for potential
              retransmission
            receiver_buffer_size - How large a buffer to keep on the receiving
              side to handle reordering, late delivery, etc.

          This transport introduces fragmentation and re-assembly logic so
          from the perspective of the transport framework it appears that
          a receiver is joining a UDP stream already in progress.

          When an unrecoverable fault is detected, the transport currently
          sets the disconnected flag.  This should eventually be configurable
          through QoS parameters.

          Earlier versions of TAO (such as 1.4a) don't work properly with the
          tao_idl -Sa -St options.  This check-in provides an MPC feature that
          will be used to turn on or off the -Sa -St options.

        * MPC/config/dcps.mpb:
        * dds/dcps_bits.mpb:

          Default to call tao_idl with -Sa and -St arguments to suppress
          generation of CORBA Any and Typecode operations.

        * dds/DdsDcpsInfrastructure.idl:
        * dds/DdsDcpsPublication.idl:
        * dds/DdsDcpsSubscription.idl:

          Place Built-in Topic specific code within #ifndef DDS_MINIMUM_BIT so
          that even more is excluded from the build when the MPC feature
          built_in_topics is zero.

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          As a consequence of the above IDL changes, the
          get_matched_{publication,subscription}_data() operations are not
          available in a built_in_topics=0 build.  Before this change the
          operations were present but returned an "unsupported" error code.

        * tests/DCPS/BuiltInTopic/common.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/BuiltInTopic/main.cpp:

          Added a way for main() to inform common.cpp that the transports need
          to be unloaded.  Without this the transports would attempt to unload
          after main() completes (due to static destructors).  The transports
          can't unload after main() completes because the dynamic libraries
          that implement that transports have already been unloaded.

        * tests/DCPS/BuiltInTopic/run_test.pl:

          Since SimpleTCP is now a separate library, need to enable the
          -ORBSvcConf argument to load it.

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfoRepo.mpc:
        * dds/dcps_bits.mpb:

          Added the ability to build without built-in topic support as an MPC
          feature.  To use, run mwc.pl like so (from $DDS_ROOT):
                  mwc.pl -type gnuace -features built_in_topics=0 DDS.mwc
          Alternatively, add "built_in_topics=0" to default.features within
          $ACE_ROOT/bin/MakeProjectCreator/config (the former method is
          preferred so that we don't have DDS-specific modifications within the
          ACE source tree).

          Also, cleaned up the various mpb and mpc files to simplify things.

        * dds/DCPS/TypeSupportImpl.h:

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/*.{h,cpp,inl}:

          Normalized all #include preprocessor directives to have exactly one
          space after the #include.  Also, enabled PCH for SimpleTCP since it
          was still referencing dds/DCPS from one it used to be part of that
          library.

        * DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/Messenger.mpc:

          Made the project names consistent (DDS_Messenger_idl instead of
          Messenger_idl).

        * tests/DCPS/BuiltInTopic/run_test.pl:

          $DDS_ROOT/bin for the executable.

Wed Feb  7 23:20:35 UTC 2007  Ciju John  <johnc@ociweb.com>

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:
          Minor modifications.

Wed Feb  7 16:38:18 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/Messenger.mpc:

          Added "after" clauses to ensure that the client and server are not
          built until the IDL-generated files are in place.  This .mpc file
          should be the "gold standard" of how to use MPC with DDS.  It factors
          out the common IDL tasks so that the client and server projects can
          be run in parallel (VC8 and GNU make -j) without errors.

Wed Feb  7 16:01:49 UTC 2007  Ciju John  <johnc@ociweb.com>

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:
          Add release notes for the 0.10 release.

Mon Feb  5 18:04:11 UTC 2007  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest5/run_test.pl:

          Added SimpleTcp service config to mixed_trans test to load the
          SimpleTcp library. This would fix the mixed transport test failure.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpLoader.cpp:

          Added transport type checking and print error if an incorrent type
          provided by service config file.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleUnreliableDgram/SimpleUnreliableDgramLoader.cpp:

          Updated incorrect type error message to have ERROR keyword to be easy for
          debugging.

Mon Feb  5 16:24:06 UTC 2007  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * bin/dcps_tests.lst:

          Added missing ":" that makes the build configuration be the
          parameter of test script.

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DomainParticipantImpl.cpp:

          Fixed warnings due unused or not initialized local variables.

Fri Feb  2 23:49:00 UTC 2007  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Added notes for SimpleMcast support and refactor of SimpleUdp and
          SimpleMcast.

Fri Feb  2 22:36:00 UTC 2007  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/sub_udp.ini:
        * DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/pub_udp.ini:

          Removed transport configuration attributes that are for SimpleTcp
          and not for SimpleUdp to avoid confusion.

Fri Feb  2 20:37:16 UTC 2007  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/Reconnect.mpc:
        * tests/DCPS/sub_init_loop/sub_init_loop.mpc:

          Moved "requires += exceptions" to the base project since all DDS apps
          now require exceptions.

          Eliminated "unused local variable"-type warnings that were left over
          from the scripted removal of exception macros.

Fri Feb  2 15:03:56 UTC 2007  Ciju John  <johnc@ociweb.com>

        * DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/Messenger.mpc:
          Factor our common build segments to avoid conflicts in parallel
          build systems (-j > 1).

Fri Feb  2 14:46:39 UTC 2007  Ciju John  <johnc@ociweb.com>

        * bin/dcps_tests.lst:
          Unknowingly introduced character created a wrong file
          patch. Fixed it.

Thu Feb  1 23:30:48 UTC 2007  Ciju John  <johnc@ociweb.com>

        * bin/dcps_tests.lst:
          Most tests now need to dynamically load the SimpleTCP
          library. Don't run those on static builds.

Thu Feb  1 22:47:13 UTC 2007  Ciju John  <johnc@ociweb.com>

        * MPC/config/dcpsexe_with_tcp.mpb:
          MPC configuration for linking application against SimpleTCP.

          cosmetic changes.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportFactory.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportFactory.cpp:
          Remove code to auto-config SimpleTCP. The assumption that
          SimpleTCP is part of the DDS core is no longer valid.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/RepoIdSet.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/RepoIdSetMap.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/RepoIdSetMap.inl:

          Fixed a bug that the FULLY_ASSOCIATION message serialize
          stream contains size_t data. Since size_t is platform
          dependent, this makes the FULLY_ASSOCIATION message
          deserialized incorrectly in the inter-host test. Replacing
          size_t with CORBA::ULong fixed the problem.

        These changes refactored SimpleUdp and SimpleMcast (unreliable multicast)
        and supported default transport ids for SimpleMcast. A new library
        - SimpleUnreliableDgram replaced the SimpleUdp and SimpleMcast.(See 9775)

          Merged SimpleUdp and SimpleMcast transport together in SimpleUnreliableDgram library.
          The -type parameter in service configuration specifies which transport will register
          with the transport factory. A process can register both "SimpleUdp" and "SimpleMcast"
          or one of the two transports via service configuration.

        * DCPS/transport/framework/TransportDefs.h:

          Added two default id for SimpleMcast, one for subscriber (DEFAULT_SIMPLE_MCAST_SUB_ID)
          and one for publisher (DEFAULT_SIMPLE_MCAST_PUB_ID).

        * DCPS/transport/framework/TransportGenerator.h:
        * DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpGenerator.h:
        * DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpGenerator.cpp:

          Added default_transport_ids() function to support multiple default transport
          ids configuration registration and added transport id parameter to new_configuration()
          to provide different default configurations for the transport.

        * DCPS/transport/framework/TransportFactory.h:
        * DCPS/transport/framework/TransportFactory.cpp:

          Removed the default transport id parameter from the register_generator (). The default
          ids will be provided by generator via default_transport_ids(). Upon the transport library
          loading, the default transport configurations will be created and registered with the
          transport factory.

        * MPC/config/dcpsexe_with_unreliable_dgram.mpb:

          Added the project base depend on SimpleUnreliableDgram lib.

        * MPC/config/dcpsexe_with_mcast.mpb:
        * MPC/config/dcpsexe_with_udp.mpb:

          The "max_output_pause_period" configuration is added to
          SimpleMcast and SimpleUdp as in SimpleTcp. This is the
          maximum period (in milliseconds) of not being able to send
          queued messages. If there are samples queued and no output
          for longer than this period then the socket will be closed
          and on_*_lost() callbacks will be called. If the value is
          zero, the default, then this check will not be made.

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.h:
        Re-worked the servant_to_reference function template in two ways:
        A. Simplified template parameters so that they can always be deduced
        from the argument passed in (pointer-to-servant).
        B. Used explicit activation on the POA instead of implicit activation
        this makes the DDS implementation compatible with CORBA/e-compact.
        Please from now on, only use explicit activation of servants.  If you
        are going to activate on the root POA of DDS's ORB (the normal case),
        then just call TAO::DCPS::servant_to_reference() -- it will return the
        typed _ptr.

        * dds/DCPS/WriteDataContainer.cpp:
          In situations of repeated connection restablishment
          from the subscriber, we seem to get some orphan messages
          left behind in the system. When the system shuts down
          due to the cleanup mechanism now in place we enter a
          for-ever loop.
          The problem is most probably due to missing error handling
          somewhere in the element delivery path and fixing that is the
          real solution as otherwise over time the internal buffers will
          just fill up (currently only observed upon connection disruption).
          For now I am putting this code which will trap and cleanup these
          orphan messages at shutdown time.

          local_address_, multicast_group_address_, and receiver_.

          See the FooTest5 changes for information about how to configure
          publishers and subscribers to use multicast.

          always returns the default type name (interface repository id).
          It should returns the name actually registered either from
          the user (via register_type) or the default type name
          (interface repository id).

Tue Jan  9 15:29:59 UTC 2007  Ciju John  <johnc@ociweb.com>

        * PROBLEM-REPORT-FORM:

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:

          Fixed the recursively acquiring non-recursive lock problem
          in remove_all_control_msgs (). To fix it, move the lock
          from remove_sample_i() to the caller functions.

          disconnect message in
          SimpleTcpDataLink::send_graceful_disconnect_message() and
          made TransportSendStrategy::suspend_send() not reset the
          suspend state when it's already in terminate state. This
          should fix some race condition when terminate_send() is
          called before sending disconnect message.

          Added default transport id (TransportIdType) parameter to
          register_generator() so the transport configuation with
          the default transport ID (DEFAULT_SIMPLE_TCP_ID or
          DEFAULT_SIMPLE_UDP_ID) will be registered.

          tests this bug fix.

Thu Jan  4 18:54:17 UTC 2007  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/BasicQueueLinkAllocator_T.h:

Tue Jan  2 22:55:40 UTC 2007  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * bin/dcps_tests.lst:

          Excluded builtin topic tests from nightly builds since they
          are not well implemented.

Tue Jan  2 22:43:33 UTC 2007  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest4_0/main.cpp:

          Removed the reference of the reader_transport_impl and
          writer_transport_impl before shutdown the transport.
          This would fix access violation on windows.

Wed Dec 20 16:29:36 UTC 2006  Ciju John  <johnc@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest4_0/main.cpp:

Tue Dec 19 16:53:06 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/subscriber.cpp:

          Made subscriber wait for 5 seconds (>passive_reconnect_duration)
          to give transport time to detect the connection lost due to
          backpressure timeout before shutdown the datareader. This should fix
          the bp_timeout test failure on not receiving the subscription lost
          callback.

Tue Dec 19 15:58:47 UTC 2006  Ciju John  <johnc@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DdsDcpsInfrastructure.idl:
          Include a TAO IDL to bypass a vc71/vc8/intel c++ issue with base
          template export.

Mon Dec 18 18:10:11 UTC 2006  Ciju John  <johnc@ociweb.com>

          Add missing header file.

Fri Dec 15 22:24:07 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DomainParticipantImpl.cpp:

          Made the topic object reference removed from map after deactivated
          from poa.  This would fix access violation in FooTest5 (during
          DomainParticipantImpl::delete_contained_entities()).

          The TransportControlElement is now responsible for its own life
          cycle management. TransportQueueElements cleanup needs to be
          thread-aware.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:

          New file, which will pull in all ACE+TAO dependencies
          needed to build the TAO_DDS middleware and put them
          in a single build.

Fri Dec  8 22:31:28 UTC 2006  Ciju John  <johnc@ociweb.com>

        The DataWriter & DataReader Listener now have an additional
          callback API 'on_connection_deleted'. This gets invoked when the

          Cleaning up debugging messages.

Fri Dec  8 19:38:39 UTC 2006  Ciju John  <johnc@ociweb.com>

          Rework thread-per-connection (TPC) to be able to remove
          transitions elements in the tpc queue. This was contributed by
          Yan Dai (dai_y@ociweb.com) to fix potential memory leaks in TPC

Thu Dec  7 15:18:32 UTC 2006  Ciju John  <johnc@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:
          New API release_resources (called by concrete transport
          object upon DataLink disconnection). This just forwards the
          message to the TransportImpl object.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkCleanupTask.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkCleanupTask.cpp:
          A dedicated task belonging to the TransportImpl object. The
          TransportImpl adds safe (ref counted) DataLinks to the task. The
          task then cleans up any resources associated with the
          DataLink. This mechanism (top level dedicated thread) was
          preffered as we were able to reuse most of the
          remove_association logic even though the triger is comming up
          from the transport-specific ReConnection logic.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportControlElement.cpp:
          Initialize the TransportControlElement with loan count of 1
          (instead of 0 as before). This is because the Control Element is
          to be sent to only one DataLink.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportDebug.h:
          Change Default debug level to 1.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.cpp:
          Change find_publication/find_subscription API to optionally
          return a safe copy (ref incremented) of the target
          DataWriter/DataReader. This prevents the DataWriter getting
          wipped out during a send.
          New API release_link_resources (called by shutdown
          DataLink). This bumps up the DataLink ref count and adds it to
          the DataLinkCleanup task (which in turn cleans up DataLink
          resources).

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportQueueElement.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportQueueElement.inl:
          Change variable names to better reflect usage. Also take out the
          loan count assert in production code.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:
          Fix race condition in 'send_delayed_notifications'. The delayed
          notification count was being read outside the guard. This could
          change before guard acquisition. Now the read is done after
          guard acquisition.
          Change clear API to accept an optional next SendMode. The
          default is still MODE_DIRECT.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConfiguration.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConfiguration.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConfiguration.cpp:
          New configuration option 'passive_connect_duration' to set
          timeout on initial passive connection establishment. Setting
          this prevents deadlock when the InfoRepo directs us to connect
          with a bogus/dead publisher.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:
          The reconnect task gets cleaned up in the Connection object
          destructor, no need for shutdown() to cleanup. The shutdown
          cleanup was a temporary fix (for cleaning threads) to deal with
          subscriber crashes. Now we have a dedicated top-level thread to
          cleanup any associated DataLink resources upon subscriber
          crash. This will cleanup the Connection object as well as the
          associated Reconnect task.
          Added new API (called by the reconnect task) to inform the
          DataLink regards loss of its connection.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.cpp:
          Fix race-condition in sending graceful disconnect message. If
          mode is 'queue', the heap element will get queued and a race
          begins as to which thread (worker thread/ORB thread) will delete
          the element. Now DataLink gets terminated right after sending
          the graceful disconnect message. Once the DataLink is
          terminated the worker thread bows out of the race and the
          element can be safely deleted by the original creator (ORB
          thread).

          Add locks to protect shared data.
          Better usage of locks and reference counting, rather than hold
          locks for extended invocations.
          In TransportSendStrategy set DELAY_NOTIFICATION to be default
          for direct_send(). This could delay things a bit in the normal
          case but doing an immediate notification has been observed to
          deadlock in the DCPS layer in stress conditions. This occurs
          when the data_deliverd () call winds its way from the transport
          to DCPS layer while another thread is winding its way up.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSetMap.cpp:
          Renamed lock_ to map_lock_ to make it self-documenting.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/EntryExit.h:
          The EntryExit class does a run-time check before initializing

          Use a set size array, rather than ACE_CString data members.
          Defined a set of macros for logging levels. This allows logs
          above a sepecified level to be compiled out. This coupled with
          the run-time check should speed up things. The new design tries
          to minimize the performnace hit of logging.

          Adding a new regression test to capture a failing scenario. The
          Subscriber is killed (simulating a crash) after
          initialization. The Publisher then crashes during its
          initialization.

      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:

        Fixed a problem that send or send_stop could happen after the datalink
        call send strategy to clear samples when keep_link=1.

      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportInterface.cpp:

        Fixed a problem that the send_start could send on a nil datalink.
        The problem is the send() could find the local_id with an empty
        datalink set because a datalink insertion to local_map_ was completed
        by two calls in add_associations().
            this->local_map_.find_or_create_set()
            local_set->insert_link()
        To fix this problem, the two calls above was replaced by a single
        call this->local_map_.insert_link().

      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.inl:
      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.h:

        Added new methods to handle the send() calls after clear()
        is called when keep_link=1.

      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ThreadPerConnectionSendTask.h:
      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ThreadPerConnectionSendTask.cpp:

        Made remove_sample() and remove_all_control_msgs() not handled by
        the thread per connection task. This would avoid the access violation
        when the data_delivered is called after sample is moved to release_data
        list and before send strategy remove_sample() is called.

      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:

        Made data_delievered/data_dropped call delayed in a few places to handle
        the writer lock and send strategy lock acquired in reverse order when
        thread_per_connection is enabled.
        Fixed a bug in send_stop() that cause crash when the header_.length > 0
        but elems_ is empty.
        Fixed a bug in remove_sample() that should return when the sample is removed
        from queue.

        on gcc compiler.

Wed Sep  7 06:59:35 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

      The main changes are: (See RT8999)
        - Made the DCPS entity servants deleted upon delete_*()
          call instead of upon orb shutdown. This would make the create/delete
          DCPS entity multiple times in a single process without shutdown
          Service Participant.
        - Added keep_link configuration to indicate whether a datalink should
          be maintained when all associations are removed. This would allow
          the datareader/datawriter reconnect repeatedly using the same
          connection.

      * dds/DCPS/WriteDataContainer.cpp:
      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSet.cpp:

        Added logging for cached allocator information.

      * dds/DCPS/DomainParticipantFactoryImpl.cpp:
      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.cpp:

        Added guard to protect unregistration of subscription.

      * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.cpp:

        Made send_graceful_disconnect_message() call notify the
        send strategy terminate send except the graceful disconnect
        message.

      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.h:
      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:
      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.inl:

        Made the release_reservations() not release datalink when
        all associations are removed if keep_link is configured to be on.
        Made the remove_sample() and remove_all_control_msgs_i() handled
        by ThreadPerConnectionSendTask when thread_per_connection is
        enabled. This makes the send() and remove_sample() be handled
        sequentially.

      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportConfiguration.h:
      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportConfiguration.cpp:
      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportConfiguration.inl:

        Added a new configuration - "keep_link", which indicates if the
        data link should be maintained when all associations are removed.
        The default value (0) means the link will be released as the
        last association is removed from the link.

      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:

        Added delayed_notification_mode_ status so the delayed notification
        will know if it's a data_delievered or data_dropped.
        Added clear() function to clean up the elements referenced by this
        datalink. This would let the datalink be reused when keep_link is
        on.

      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/QueueTaskBase_T.h:

        Commented error log when the dequeue_head failed.
        I'm not sure why this thread got more signals than actual signals
        when using thread_per_connection and the user application thread
        send requests without interval.

      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ThreadPerConnectionSendTask.h:
      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ThreadPerConnectionSendTask.cpp:

        Made this task handle the REMOVE_SAMPLE and REMOVE_ALL_CONTROL_SAMPLES
        requests.

      * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.h:
      * dds/DCPS/Cached_Allocator_With_Overflow_T.h:

        Corrected a logging message.

      * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.h:

        Added deactivate_object template function so the delete_* can
        call it to deactivate the object from poa and cause the deletion
        of the servant.

      * dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.cpp:
      * dds/DCPS/SubscriberImpl.cpp:
      * dds/DCPS/DomainParticipantImpl.cpp:

        Added deactivate_object() call in delete_*() functions.

      * DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/pub.ini:

        Added keep_link configuration.

      * DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/subscriber.cpp:
      * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/subscriber.cpp:

        Removed the get_matched_publications() call since datareader
        servant is destroyed when delete_datareader() is called.

Thu Aug 24 18:12:24 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:

          Corrected number of chunks for message block allocator in a
          logging message.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.cpp:

          Corrected the DataReaderImpl/DataWriterImpl reference hold
          by TransportImpl. This fixed the memory leak of datawriter.

Sun Aug 13 19:17:53 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

          These changes supported the default transport id.
          The range 0xFFFFFF00 to 0xFFFFFFFF is reserved for
          DEFAULT_<transport>_CONFIG values. Each specific transport
          has its default id in that range. The default transports can not
          be configured by the users. [See RT 8497]

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportDefs.h:

          Added definition for DEFAULT_SIMPLE_TCP_ID and
          DEFAULT_SIMPLE_UDP_ID.

          Increased the size of the section array in load() so it has
          enough space for a big transport id.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportFactory.cpp:

          Made the load_transport_configuration() check configuration load
          return value.

                Worked around with the compilation problems on DDS gcc 4.x build with
                DOC version TAO. The problem is the ACE_EXPORT_SINGLETON_DECLARE
                new definition was added to config-g++-common.h in DOC version
                which causes the template instantiation inside namespace errors.
                To work around this problem the TAO_DDSDCPS_SINGLETON_DECLARE
                is commented for gcc 4.x builds.

        * AUTHORS:
        * NEWS:
        * configure.ac:

          Added files that are needed to generate automake makefiles. The following
          command must be used to generate them from MPC:

            $MPC_ROOT/mwc.pl -include $ACE_ROOT/bin/MakeProjectCreator/config
             -type automake DDS.mwc

          You must not run mwc.pl from $ACE_ROOT/bin to do this.
          The ACE_ROOT, TAO_ROOT and DDS_ROOT environment variables must be set.
          Additionally, ACE_BUILDDIR should be set to $ACE_ROOT and TAO_BUILDDIR
          should be set to $TAO_ROOT.

          Please note that this is experimental and has not been fully tested.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/RepoIdSetMap.cpp:

          Made demarshal not return error if the repo id is already in the
          map since the subscriber could send the ack for the same repo id
          multiple times.

Mon Jul 17 05:52:33 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.cpp:

          Fixed a bug that the length of data message block is not
          written to the sample header. This would cause the publisher
          side not deliver the graceful disconnect messages even though
          it received the message from subscriber.

Sun Jul  3 8:42:38 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        These changes support thread-per-connection send feature. The
        new configuration "thread_per_connection" is added to determine if
        the transport needs create a new thread for a datalink/connection
        to send samples under normal traffic (no backpressure). If
        thread_per_connection is 1, the publisher always creates a seperate
        send thread for each datalink/connection to do the send instead of
        sending to each remote one by one by the same thread.

        * dds/DdsDcps.mpc:

          Added new classes to support thread-per-connection send feature.

          sending in a seperate thread.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/QueueTaskBase_T.h:

          A simple template ACE task that manages a request queue. The subclass

          Added thread_per_connection configuration.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.h:

          Added DataLink as friend of TransportImpl so DataLink can
          access the private data member configuration object of
          TransportImpl.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:

          Updated to use the new interfaces of the SimpleReconnectTask
          and made the reconnect_task_ allocated on stack instead of
          on heap.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnectionReplaceTask.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnectionReplaceTask.h:

          a new connection is accepted by the passive side.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.cpp:

        These changes fixed the test using simpleUDP. The commit
        "Thu Jun 22 16:06:21 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>" appears
        broke the UDP tests during the full association period.

          Added new virtual function acked() to check if the acks for
          pending associations are received so the simpleUDP can simply
          always return acked.

        * TAO/DDS/DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/subscriber.cpp:

          Added more sleep period before releasing transport factory. This
          would avoid the error on publisher during shutdown.

          "Fri Jun  9 07:37:12 UTC 2006  Johnny Willemsen  <jwillemsen@remedy.nl>"
          These changes broke the Linux build.

Thu Jun 22 16:06:21 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        These changes mainly fix the problem
         "create_datawriter() does not wait for full association establishment
         so even if there are waiting subscribers,  a write shortly after
         creating the datawriter may be dropped on the publisher side because
         add_associations() has not completed on the publisher side.
         The sample may also be dropped on the subscriber side because the
         connection exists between the publisher and subscriber but the
         associations have not been mapped on the subscriber side."

         The solution is to make the subscriber send a FULLY_ASSOCIATED ack
         when the new association is received from repo and the connection is
         established. On the publisher side, the transport will notify the
         datawriter that the subscriber is fully associated when the ack is
         received. The application can use get_matched_subscriptions() to
         determine when it should start sending samples.

          Renamed the TransportGDControlElement.* to TransportControlElement.*
          so it can be used for both GRACEFUL_DISCONNECT and FULLY_ASSOCIATED
          messages.

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.h:

          Seperated remote reader handler caching and the listener
          on_publication_matched callback from add_associations(). The new
          method fully_associated() does that part which is called when the
          transport received the FYULLY_ASSOCIATED message from subscriber.

        * dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.cpp:

          Made the publisher not delete the associations after add_publication()
          is done. The associations will be deleted when transport calls the
          full_associated().

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.h:

          Added local map to cache the pending association ids,pending
          association data and acked associations.

          Notify the datawriter fully association at an approriated time
          which depend on the timing when pending association is added,
          when ack is received and when the datawriter is registered with
          the TransportImpl. At either time, the pending and ack map will
          be checked to see if any assoications related to a pub id is
          fully associated.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:

          Added shutdown_ flag to stop the reconnecting during shutdown.
          The shutdown reconnect task call is removed from the connection
          destructor, the shutdown will be called when the connection related
          association is removed or when the transport shutdown. This would
          avoid the destruction order problem of the connection and
          reconnect task objects.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.cpp:

        * TAO/DDS/dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy.h:

          Fixed a deadlock situation on linux when the direct_send()
          detects a lost connection and calls the relink(). The problem is the
          direct_send() is called under the lock in send strategy and the
          suspend_send() called by relink() aquires the same lock.
          To fix it, an extra parameter do_suspend is added to relink()
          function to indicate if the relink() needs call suspend_send() on
          send strategy object. If the thread calling relink() already hold
          the lock it will call the operations in suspend_send() before calling
          relink (), otherwise the relink() will call suspend_send().

          Added shutdown () method to SimpleTcpConnection to shutdown the
          reconnect task. This is called during transport pre-shutdown phase
          after the datalink sends graceful disconnect message. This would
          avoid an access violation during transport shutdown.

        * TAO/DDS/dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.cpp:

          Made the shutdown () do shutdown work just once if it's called multiple
          times.

        * TAO/DDS/dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Corrected a debug message.

Wed Jun  7 18:30:09 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Added a limitation that transport can not receive single packet

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Added VC6 build support and a potential deadlock fix.

Fri May 12 00:00:27 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.h:

          Renamed the second version of servant_to_reference() to
          servant_to_reference_2 to resolve the compilation errors
          on VC6. The VC6 can not recognize the template function
          with same name but difference template parameters.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/publisher.cpp:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/subscriber.cpp:

          Updated to use servant_to_reference_2().

          Added the thr_id_ data for checking if the shutdown()
          is called by the thread the task created. The thread
          should not wait for itself. This should fix a potential
          deadlock.

Mon May  8 20:16:50 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

          DDS 0.8 released.

        * VERSION:

          Updated timestamp of the 0.8 release.

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Updated one limitation note.

        * dds/DCPS/Qos_Helper.h:
        * dds/DCPS/Qos_Helper.inl:

          Moved the qos operator functions from TAO::DCPS namespace to global
          namespace. This would resolve the compilation errors on DDS builds
          against DOC's latest version that the VC71 compiler can not find
          the octet sequence operator==.

        * tests/DCPS/BuiltInTopic/main.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/FooTest3_0/PubDriver.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/FooTest4/main.cpp:

          Made the qos operator== called implicitly instead of explicitly.
          Calling operator== explicitly was used as a workarround of the
          compilation problem metioned above.

        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/run_test.pl:

          Added expected lost_subscription_callback=1 to the bp_timeout test.
          This fixed the test failure on windows.

          Added inheritance from portableserver base project.
          This would resolve compilation errors shown on static builds on linux
          platforms.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/run_test-2p3s.pl:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/run_test-4p1s.pl:

          Made the repo use the repo.conf to avoid multiple requests
          handled by single orb thread at the same time. This would
          fix the problem on sunos59 gcc3.3.2 builds that the DCPSInfo
          could not be terminated. It seems without using the service
          config file, the DCPSInfo deadlocked and the TerminateWaitKill()
          in perl script will return non-zero which causes the test failure.

Fri May  5 14:44:39 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Updated notes for re-establishment of lost connection.

Thu May  4 20:06:22 UTC 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSet_rch.h

          Reversed the changes Scott made on
          "Thu Dec 15  8:35:17 USMST 2005 2005  Scott Harris  <harris_s@ociweb.com>"
          since the TAO1.4a latest version works without the change.

Wed May  3 11:30:09 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * performance-tests/DCPS/SimpleLatency/PubListener.cpp:

          Changed from char* to const char* to avoid build warnings from
          SunCC.

        * tests/DCPS/MultiDPTest/common.h:

          Removed the trailing comma from an enum to avoid build warnings
          from SunCC.

Tue May  2 16:59:07 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Qos_Helper.inl:

          Changed to call operator==(TAO::unbounded_value_sequence<CORBA::Octet>)
          explicitly. It is ugly but it resolves the compilation error on VC71
          against DOC's latest version. This seems be a compiler problem that
          does not recognize the global operator== when the global operator== is
          defined as inline and it's called by the code inside of a namespace.

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:
        * dds/DCPS/SubscriberImpl.cpp:

          Fix bugs on subscriber that does not increase the sequence length
          before adding new elements to the sequence. This problem was detected
          in FooTest4_0 with the DOC's latest version which has the new sequence
          implementation.

          Added inheritance from portableserver base project for subscriber.
          This would resolve compilation errors shown on static builds on linux
          platforms.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:

          Replaced the close() in SimpleTcpReconnectTask with shutdown ()
          method. The difference is the shutdown() will wait for thread
          exit. This would resolve an access violation due to the race
          condition in the SimpleTcpReconnectTask object
          Some un-necessary variables num_threads_ and active_workers_
          are also removed.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.cpp:

          Made the Datalink not send the GRACEFUL_DISCONNECT message if
          it already received the GRACEFUL_DISCONNECT message from peer.
          This would fix the error
          "SimpleTcpSendStrategy::send_bytes: ERROR: sendv: Bad file
           descriptor iovec count: 3" upon shutdown.

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Fixed a warning with unused variable.

Fri Apr 28 12:59:58 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        These changes fixes a problem on linux that transport does not
        identify peer disconnecting due to crash. This should fix
        the "run_test.pl restart_pub" test on linux.

        * dds/DdsDcps.mpc:

          Added TransportGDControlElement.cpp.

        * dds/DCPS/DataSampleHeader.h:

          Added GRACEFUL_DISCONNECT message id.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.h:

          Added new hooks so the concrete datalink can send graceful
          disconnect message before transport shutdown or releasing
          datalink.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportGDControlElement.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportGDControlElement.h:

          New type control message that does not need data_delivered
          callback.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportReceiveStrategy.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportReceiveStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.cpp:

          Made the transport also try to reconnect if it did not receive
          the graceful disconnect message when receive_bytes() returns 0.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:

          This is the correct version that Scott committed for fixing

          Correct a typo in a log message.

Sun Apr 23 22:50:40 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

          Fixed memory leaks and added more debugging messages.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.inl:

          Fixed multiple reconnected notification problem. The problem
          is the passive connection side seems not realize the lost
          connection before a new connection is reestablished.
          Changed to use the enum reconnect_state_ instead of a bool
          variable to mark various states during reconnecting and also
          seperate the active_reconnect_on_new_association() from
          active_reconnect_i() to make these function more obvious.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.inl:

          Made the elems_ and queue_ to be allocated on heap. This would help
          resolve a deadlock situation after reconnect fails. The deadlock
          happens when a send thread holds datawriter's lock and try to acquire
          the SendStrategy's lock and the reconnect thread calls terminate_send
          which got the SendStrategy's lock and drop all queued samples and try
          to call data_dropped on DataWriter. The changes makes we can remove
          queued elements outside the SendStrategy's lock.

          Changed to create per connection reconnect task to do the reconnecting instead
          of using single thread to do reconnecting for all datalinks in a TransportImpl.
          Hope this fix the rae\rt8448\test failure

          implementations.

Fri Apr 21 01:09:00 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        The main changes are made to add the on_*_reconnected and on_*_disconnected
        new callbacks for RT8499.

        * dds/DdsDcpsPublication.idl:
        * dds/DdsDcpsSubscription.idl:

          Added the on_*_reconnected and on_*_disconnected callbacks
          Updated the *LostStatus to just contain the instance handles
          and typedef'd the *LostStatus as *DisconnectedStatus and
          *ReconnectedStatus.

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.h:

          Made the DataReader/DataWriter not cache the *LostStatus and
          added notify_*_diconnected and notify_*_reconnected to support
          the new callbacks.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.inl:

          Updated the notify() function for DISCONNECTED, RECONNECTED and
          LOST connection notification.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.inl:

          On active connection side, made the disconnected callback called
          before reconnect, the reconnceted callback called after reconnect
          succeeded and the lost connection callback called after reconnet
          failed.
          On passive connection side, made the disconnected callback called
          before reconnectschedule the timer, the reconnceted callback called
          when new connection is created and the lost connection callback
          called after the passive_reconnect_duration_ period if not reconnected.
          Updated some methods to correct the reconnect logic on the passive side.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.cpp:

          Changed to use the "old" connection object to transfer its state to
          the "new" connection object instance of using "new" connection object
          copy state from "old" connection object. This was changed since we
          need synchronize the handle_timeout() and transfer state to "new"
          connection object on the "old" connection object.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/run_test-4p1s.pl:

          Increased amount of time for the DCPSInfoRepo to shutdown.

Thu Apr 20 13:40:46 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.h:

          Updated the data_dropped() method signature to be same as in the base
          class TransportSendListener. This would fix the errors
          "ERROR: Subclass should override if sending control samples. "
          when the transport drops the control messages due to a lost
          connection.

Wed Apr 19 19:13:01 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * bin/dcps_tests.lst:

          Added tests/DCPS/Reconnect tests.

        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/DataReaderListener.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/DataWriterListener.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/publisher.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/subscriber.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/Writer.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/run_test.pl:

          Added more options to publisher and subscriber to help automate the
          reconnect tests. Changed run_test.pl to redirect the output to a log
          file so that errors due to an abnormal shutdown and lost connection
          will not show on scoreboard. The final output "test PASSED" or
          "test FAILED" will show the test result.

Wed Apr 19 13:04:26 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest3_0/FooTest3_0.mpc:

          Added inheritance from portableserver base project for subscriber.
          This would resolve compilation errors shown on static builds on linux
          platforms.

Mon Apr 17 09:45:30 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Added release notes for main changes after 0.7 release.

        * tests/DCPS/DCPSInfoRepo/DCPSDataWriterI.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/DCPSInfoRepo/DCPSDataReaderI.h:
        * tests/DCPS/DCPSInfoRepo/DCPSDataReaderI.cpp:

          Added the notify_lost bool parameter to the remove_association()
          method which overrides the virtual methods in
          TAO::DCPS::DataReaderImpl/DataWriterImpl. This should fix the
          test failure on remove_association.

Sun Apr 16 21:43:11 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendListener.cpp:

          Fixed a compilation warning due to an unused variable.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSynchResource.cpp:

          Fixed a bug on wait_to_unclog that passes an ACE_Time_Value::zero
          to handle_write_ready instance of 0 as the timeout parameter.
          This would fix the TCPListener performance test.

        * tests/transport/udp_simple/SimpleDataWriter.cpp:

          More scoreboard directed cleanup.

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest4/main.cpp:

          This change from std::string to ACE_CString was not dictated by
          the nightly scoreboard, but my local PC failed to compile the
          test as provided with std::string. This is on my home x86-32
          running Linux 2.6.10-1.770_FC2 with gcc version 3.3.3 20040412
          (Red Hat Linux 3.3.3-7). I felt it was not a big deal to add the
          ACE_CString since the test code is already linking in ACE to do
          parameter parsing.

Sun Apr 16 07:30:45 2006  Phil Mesnier  <mesnier_p@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.h:

          Removed extraneous comma from enumeration list. I noticed that
          the enumeration also contains "NOTIFY_IMMEADIATELY" which should
          be changed to "NOTIFY_IMMEDIATELY". I'm not going to change that
          because I don't know the implications of such a change.

Sat Apr 15 13:23:09 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        These changes are tested on linux and fixed the deadlock situation
        during reconnecting.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy.cpp:

          Made the send strategy will not wait for the reconnecting finish
          since the thread might hold the lock in DataWriterImpl and the
          reconnect thread might need call data_dropped () on DataWriterImpl
          which will cause datalock.

Sat Apr 15 11:47:43 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

          These changes are made to expect to fix a deadlock situation during
          reconencting on linux and they also fixed unregister data sample
          errors during shutdown for RT8499.

        * dds/DCPS/WriteDataContainer.cpp:

          Updated the data_dropped() to do same thing as data delivered
          when the transport initiates the data dropping which happens when
          connection lost and reconnet fails.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.inl:

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:

          Made send strategy queue the connection to reconnect task in relink()
          and wait on a condition variable until the reconnect task completes
          the reconnecting and signal the condition. This would resolve the
          deadlock problem on linux and avoid using a recursive lock in
          TransportSendStrategy as a work around in my last commit.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportReceiveStrategy.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportReceiveStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.cpp:

          Made the relink() has no return value.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.cpp:

          Added DO_RECONNECT_UPON_SEND case to handle re-establishing
          of a lost connection detected by send strategy.

Thu Apr 13 17:01:08 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.h:

          Changed to use ACE_Recursive_Thread_Mutex to fix the deadlock
          situation during reconnecting on linux. This is a temporary
          workarround. I need find a better way to fix it.

Thu Apr 13 14:59:07 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

       * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/repo.conf:

          Added missing file.

          Fixed compilation errors on lunix build.

Thu Apr 13 12:54:39 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        These are review fix for RT8499 and the compilation errors due to
        data_dropped () and remove_sample() signature changes are also fixed.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.inl:

          Changed to use while loop instead of for loop for code clarity.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.cpp:

          Added checking of the return value from dynamic_cast.

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPS_IR_Domain.h:
        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPS_IR_Publication.h:

          Added comments for the new parameter notify_lost.

          Fixed compilation errors due to the data_dropped ()
          and remove_sample() signature changes.

Thu Apr 13 10:30:47 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        These changs are made to drop messages after the reconnect
        failed for RT8499.

        * dds/DdsDcps.mpc:

          Added RemoveAllVisitor.cpp.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/RemoveAllVisitor.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/RemoveAllVisitor.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/RemoveAllVisitor.cpp:

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendListener.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendListener.h:

          Added an extra parameter dropped_by_transport bool to the
          data_dropped(), remove_sample() and related methods. The
          dropped_by_transport true indicates the data dropping is initiated
          by transport which occurs when the transport send strategy is in
          a MODE_TERMINATED state. All messages are dropped in that state.
          The dropped_by_transport false which is the case before adding
          this extra parameter. The dropping is a result of remove_sample()
          call which is initiated by datawriter with KEEP_LAST history policy
          when the number of samples exceeds the depth of history queue.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.inl:

          Added a few SendMode types(MODE_TERMINATED, MODE_SUSPEND and
          MODE_NOT_SET). These modes are used when reconnecting logic is
          used. When the connection is lost, the mode is set to
          MODE_SUSPEND until reconnect finishes. In the MODE_SUSPEND state,
          all messages are queued. If the reconnect succeeds, the mode is
          back to the state before suspend. If the reconnect fails after
          a "conn_retry_attempts" attempts, then the mode is set to
          MODE_TERMINATED and all messages in the backpressure queue and
          packet queue are removed and the data_dropped () is called for
          every element. During the state of MODE_TERMINATED, any sending
          or queuing are stopped and the messages are dropped.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.inl:

          Added send_strategy_ data member for state change when reconnecting
          happens. The suspend_send is called before reconnecting. The
          resume_send is called when the reconnect succeeds. The terminate_send
          is called after the reconnect fails.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy_rch.h:

          Removed lost_link() hook. Now we can use the mode in the
          TransportSendStrategy to know the state of the connection.

        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/run_test.pl:

          Fixed the restart_sub test since now we drop the messages
          after reconnect failed.

        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/sub.ini:

          Change to default "conn_retry_attempts".

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSynchResource.h:

          Fixed a compilation error on linux builds that need ace/Time_Value.h
          include.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConfiguration.h:

          Changed the conn_retry_backoff_multiplier_ to be double instead of float
          to avoid warnings.

Tue Apr 11 10:10:41 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        These changes are made for RT8499 to resolve the problem that publisher
        does not stop sending during reconnecting. There are two parts of the changes
        need be made and note the second part is not done yet.
          1)transport should queue the messages while reconnecting
          2)transport should discard the messages if the reconnect fails.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportReceiveStrategy.cpp:

          Made handle_input () return -1 if the receive_bytes() return -1. This would
          close the connection anyway even it will try to reconnect.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy.inl:

          Added ready_send() virtual function to check if the connection is connected.
          This will be called whenever this->synch_->work_available is called or before
          sendv. This would stop the writing on a disconnected socket.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.inl:

          Made it has reference to the SimpleTcpTransport object and
          added get_transport_impl() accessor.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.inl:

          Made relink() to queue the connection object to the SimpleTcpReconnectTask
          to do the reconnect since we don't want the reactor thread block on reconnecting
          and not receiving other incoming messages.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.h:

          Made this task handle both reconnecting and new connection checking.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.inl:

          Added reconnect task accessor so the SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy can access
          it and handle the connection to the reconnect task to do reconnect.


        These changes are made for RT8499 to add the support to declare connection
        lost upon backpressure timed out.

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Updated comments for "max_output_pause_period" configuration.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportDefs.h:

          Added GET_CONFIG_FLOAT_VALUE macro.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/PerConnectionSynch.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ThreadSynch.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ThreadSynch.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ThreadSynchResource.h:

          Made the wait_on_clogged_resource() and wait_on_unclog() return status.
          The PerConnectionSynch thread terminates if it returns an error.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConfiguration.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConfiguration.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConfiguration.inl:

          Added max_output_pause_period_ and changed the
          conn_retry_backoff_multiplier_ to be float instead of int.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.inl:

          Added new method notify_lost_on_backpressure_timeout() to support
          the disconnecting and notification when the transport stay in
          backpressure too long ( > max_output_pause_period).
          Removed unused parameter "notify" from reconnect_i().
          Accomodated with the changes of conn_retry_backoff_multiplier_
          type change.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSynchResource.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSynchResource.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSynchResource.inl:

          Made the max_output_pause_period passed to the constructor and made
          wait_to_unclog() call notify_lost_on_backpressure_timeout() upon
          handle_write_ready() timeout.

        * DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/pub.ini:
        * DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/sub.ini:
        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/pub.ini:
        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/sub.ini:

          Updated comments for the reconnect strategy configuration values and
          added new configuration "max_output_pause_period".

        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/DataReaderListener.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/subscriber.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/Writer.cpp:

          Added read/write delay for bp_timeout test.

        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/run_test.pl:

          Added bp_timeout test case.

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest4/main.cpp:

          Made subscriber attach to transport to avoid the errors return
          from create_datareader() due to no transport.

Mon Apr 10 13:03:40 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Corrected the description for "conn_retry_backoff_multiplier" configuration.

Mon Apr 10 09:20:35 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Corrected the notify_*_lost() to avoid duplicate reader/writer id
          report lost.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.inl:

          Corrected reconnect() to notify connection lost just once and not
          try to reconnect in subsequence send/recv failure.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.cpp:

          Added reconnect() call in find_or_create_datalink() method when the
          connection is previously lost and now the datalink is requested because
          of the new association.

Fri Apr  7 15:15:23 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * DDS_release_notes.txt:

          Added notes for reconnect and lost connection callback support.

        * dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/SubscriberImpl.cpp:

          Removed the "#if 0" in create_*/delete_* that was used to avoid
          some test failure, but the tests are fixed, we just remove it.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConfiguration.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConfiguration.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConfiguration.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:

        * DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/sub.ini:
        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/pub.ini:
        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/sub.ini:

          Removed the "attempt_connection_reestablishment" configuration
          since it's duplicated with other configuration values and
          updated some spelling errors with the configuration values.

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest3_0/pub_main.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/FooTest3_0/PubDriver.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/FooTest3_0/PubDriver.h:

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest3_2/PubDriver.h:

          Made the test call attach_transport before create_datawriter()
          to fix the test failures.

Fri Apr  7 00:46:47 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        These files are changed to support the connection reestablishment
        and lost connection notify. See RT8499.

        * dds/DdsDcps.mpc:

          Added new file SimpleTcpReconnectTask.h/.cpp.

        * dds/DdsDcpsDataReaderRemote.idl:
        * dds/DdsDcpsDataWriterRemote.idl:

          Added a paramter "notify_lost" to the remove_association
          in DataReaderRemote and DataWriterRemote interfaces.
          The flag true indicates the remove_association is invoked
          by the InfoRepo after it detected a lost writer/reader. The
          InfoRepo detect the lost writer/reader when the
          add_association/remove_association invocations on the writer/reader
          object reference fail. The datareader/datawriter needs notify the
          the DataReaderListener/DatawriterListener the publication/subscription
          lost.

        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataReaderImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.h:

          Added methods to support the notification of the publication/subscription
          lost and updated the remove_associations() signature change.

        * dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/SubscriberImpl.cpp:

          Made the datareader/datawriter register with the TransportImpl upon
          creation and unregister upon deletion.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.h:

          Added notify_lost() method that is called by the SimpleTcpConnection
          upon reconnect failure. Changed the receive_strategy_ to be protected
          data so the SimpleTcpDataLink can access it.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSetMap.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSetMap.h:

          Added lock to protect the map. This would fix the problem when
          multiple add_association() are called at the same time. The
          find_or_create_set() failure causes the add_association() failure.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ReceiveListenerSetMap.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ReceiveListenerSetMap.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/RepoIdSetMap.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/RepoIdSetMap.inl:

          Added internal map accessor so we can iterate the map to notify
          listener about the lost subscriptions/publication.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.h:

          Added methods to register/unregister/find the datareader
          and datawriter object.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportInterface.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportInterface.inl:

          Added TransportImpl object reference accessor.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportReceiveStrategy.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportReceiveStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportReceiveStrategy.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.inl:

          Added relink() funcation and call it when the send_packet()
          and receive_packet() return an error.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConfiguration.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConfiguration.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConfiguration.inl:

          Added new configurations to support connection re-establishment.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.inl:

          This is the main change made for the re-establish a connection.
          Added more states to have enough information for re-establish
          and reuse the connection object. If connector/acceptor role of
          the connection is not changed when the connection is re-established.
          As the connector side, we reuse the same connection object after
          reconnected. As the acceptor side, since the ACE_Acceptor creates
          a new connection each time when it accept a connection, we can not
          reuse the connection object. The states in the "old" connection
          object are copied to the "new" connection object.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpDataLink.inl:

          Added reconnect() function to replace an "old" connection with the
          "new" connection.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReceiveStrategy.inl:

          Added method to restart the ReceiveStrategy.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpReconnectTask.h:

          This is a new class that is dedicated to check if the incoming
          connections are re-established connection from the remote. This
          would resolve the deadlock problem between the reactor thread
          (calling SimpleTcpTransport::passive_connction()) and the orb
          thread (calling SimpleTcpTransport::make_passive_connction()).
          The reactor thread will enqueue the new connection  to this task
          and let this task dequeue and check the connection.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.inl:

          Called SimpleTcpReconnectTask open and close upon transport
          initialization and shutdown.

          Updated to accommodate the change of the remove_association()
          signature change.

        * DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/pub.ini:
        * DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/sub.ini:

          Added configuration values for retry connect to the example.

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest3_0/PubDriver.cpp:

        Added TypeSupport::get_type_name() support for RT8496.

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:
        * bin/DCPS/HTemplate.pm:

          Added *TypeSupportImpl::get_type_name() implementation that use
          the interface repository id as the default type name.
          Made *TypeSupportImpl::register_type() check nil type name. If a nil

          TypeSupport comparison instead of using
          _interface_repository_id() directly.

        * DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/publisher.cpp:
        * DevGuideExamples/DDS/Messenger/subscriber.cpp:

          Updated the example to test TypeSupport::get_type_name() support.
          The nil type name is passed for type registration and get_type_name()
          is called to get the type name for topic creation.

        * bin/dcps_tests.lst:

          Added TCPListenerTests to the nightly build list of tests to run.
          UDP was not added due to the highly machine dependent performance
          of UDP.

          Fixed compilation after the "using namespace" removal change.

Mon Mar 27 16:14:47 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        These changes are made to fix the DDS test failures between machines
        with different endianess. The swap_bytes configuration value per
        TransportImpl instance is also appropriately used to allow different
        transports use different setting of swap_bytes. (See RT8381)

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:

          Made the Serializer in *DataWriterImpl::marshal() constructed
          with the swap_bytes flag based on swap_byte configuration value
          and made the Serializer in *DataReaderImpl::demarshal() constructed
          with the swap_bytes flag based on the endianess of the host and
          the byte order flag from the publisher.

        * dds/DCPS/DataSampleHeader.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataSampleHeader.inl:

          Set the swap_bytes flag to the Serializer in the reading side based
          on the the endianess of the host and the byte order flag in the data
          sample from publisher.

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Made the sample and control message header correctly set byte_order.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportHeader.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportHeader.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportHeader.inl:

          Added one more octet to the TransportHeader to indicate the endianess
          of the publisher side and updated the marshal and demarshal methods
          with the new flag.

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.h:

          Moved the TransportReplaceElement cached allocator from PacketRemoveVisitor
          to TransportSendStrategy to fix a bug in the transport. The problem is
          PacketRemoveVisitor is allocated on stack so the allocator is destroyed
          as the PacketRemoveVisitor goes out of scope, but late the
          TransportReplaceElement accesses the allocator and causes the access
          voilation.

          Change the hash map using void* as the key to fix the build problem
          on 64bits build.

Tue Mar 14 12:37:29 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Registered_Data_Types.cpp:

          Changed the register_type() to use the_interface_repository_id
          comparison instead of  POA_TAO::DCPS::TypeSupport_ptr comparison.
          This would allow different TypeSupport instances of the same TypeSupport
          type register with the same type name in the same domain pariticipant.
          The second (and subsequent) registrations are ignored.

        * tests/DCPS/MultiDPTest/subscriber.cpp:

          Added a test case that registers different TypeSupport instances of
          the same TypeSupport type using the same type name in a domain
          participant.

Mon Mar 13 14:50:00 UTC 2006  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/MultiDPTest/subscriber.cpp:

Tue Jan 24 13:54:33 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        These changes fixes a bug in Registered_Data_Types that causes
        multiple domain participants within the same domain in a process
        can not register same data types. See RT8440.

        * dds/DCPS/Registered_Data_Types.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/Registered_Data_Types.h:

          Made the DomainHash hash map use DomainParticipant object reference
          as the key instead of domain id. This would allow the data type
          be unique within a DomainParticipant and not within a domain.

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:
        * dds/DCPS/DomainParticipantImpl.cpp:

          Changed transport config ""DCPSBitTransportPort" default from
          2841 to 0 so the OS will pick a port and multiple Built-in Topic
          subscribers can run on one machine.
          Fixed a bug where the config parameter "swap_bytes" was being

Fri Jan 20 13:21:40 USMST 2006  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        The main changes are adding DDS file configuration feature. The SimpleTcp
        is still a part of DDSDcps library and other concrete transport libraries
        such as SimpleUdp can be dynamically or statically loaded.
        See the projects\DDS\design\configuration_design.txt (from CVS) for
        various scenarios of using dds configurations:

          that intended to cleanup memory when the write/register fail.
          The changes need more investigation.

Mon Dec 19 09:43:03 MST 2005  Trevor Fields  <fields_t@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpTransport.cpp:

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/PacketRemoveVisitor.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/PacketRemoveVisitor.inl:

          Moved the method back to cpp and removed the ACE_INLINE
          declaration.  The method needed a define in the cpp file.

Fri Dec 16 00:50:26 MST 2005  Trevor Fields  <fields_t@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/PacketRemoveVisitor.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/PacketRemoveVisitor.inl:

          Moved the ACE_INLINE method to the inl file.  Not having it
          in the inl file results in an undefined reference when linking
          with the dll

Thu Dec 15 22:31:13 MST 2005  Trevor Fields  <fields_t@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSet_rch.h:

          Corrected capitalization of header include.

Thu Dec 15 10:08:28 USMST 2005  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSet.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSet.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSet.h:

          Corrected the number of chunks for map_entry_allocator_. It should be
          the number of datalinks. The map_ is also changed to be a pointer of
          hash map so we can appropiately delete the hash map with current
          implementation of ACE_Hash_Map_Manager_Ex and ACE_Hash_Map_With_Allocator.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.inl:

          Made number of chunks in header data block to be 1 instead of 2 since the
          duplicate() increases the ref count of data block.

        * dds/DCPS/Cached_Allocator_With_Overflow_T.h:
        * dds/DCPS/Dynamic_Cached_Allocator_With_Overflow_T.h:

          Added free_to_pool_ count to help debugging.

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Replaced ACE_CHECK with ACE_CHECK_RETURN in some methods with a return
          type.

        * dds/DCPS/WriteDataContainer.cpp:

          Made obtain_buffer() and register_instance() release memory it allocates
          if the methods return error.
          Made the number of chunks for data allocator to be the
          max_samples of resource_limits in qos if that value is not
          LENGTH_UNLIMITED.

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.cpp:

          Fixed a bug in parse_args() that causes crash when passing multiple
          -DCPS options.

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:

          Made write_w_timestamp() release marshalled data sample if write fails.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/UDPListenerTest/DataReaderListener.cpp:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/DataReaderListener.cpp:

          Uncommented the read_samples() which might be accidently checked in previously.

Thu Dec 15  8:35:17 USMST 2005 2005  Scott Harris  <harris_s@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkSet_rch.h

          Get the DdsDcps project to build against TAO v 1.4.7.
          Needed to explicitly include the ACE version header so that
          conditional complication that makes DDS build with both the DOC
          and OCI versions of TAO worked.
          Strangely, this is not needed for the latest DOC TAO from CVS
          or when building with gcc/GNUmakefile but is needed for VC71.

          TransportReplacedElement and TransportSendStrategy header message
          block allocation from heap with the cached allocator.

        * dds/DdsDcps.mpc:

          Constructor did not correctly use and save the rounded up size
           for allocating!  This resulted in invalid pointer locations
           used for small object sizes on the 64 bit OS.

        * dds/DCPS/Qos_Helper.h:
          Solaris compilers failed when the method declaration was
          extern and the definition was inline.  Added a macro
          to assign the extern when the code is not inlined.

          were choking on the extra parameter in the templated
          method.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleUDP/SimpleUdpConfiguration.inl:

          Limit the simple UDP transport to about 64 KB samples

        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/subscriber.cpp:

          Fixed the memory leak of the listener servant.
          - Made the servant assign to PortableServer::ServantBase_var.

        * dds/DCPS/DataBlockLockPool.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataBlockLockPool.h:

          Changes to compile on unix systems.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:

        * dds/DdsDcps.mpc:
        * dds/DCPS/DataBlockLockPool.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/DataBlockLockPool.h:

          Created a class to give out ACE_Thread_Mutex lock adapters.
          This just cycles through an array giving out the next lock.
          It does not currently require the returning of the locks.

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:
        * bin/DCPS/HTemplate.pm:

          Changed to use a DataBlockLockPool for providing locks to the
          ACE_Data_Blocks.  The blocks need to be locked to prevent the
          simultaneous access by multiple threads from deforming the
          reference count.

        * dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/SubscriberImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.h:

          Rolled back previous version and found the memory
          leak is in the reference_to_servant function
          of Service_Participant.

Wed Jul 27 11:03:25 MST 2005  Trevor Fields  <fields_t@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.inl:

          Added additional code to give more information when the send_bytes
          fails.  This code is marked with "//remove" and
          "DUMP_FOR_PACKET_INFO"

          This code should be removed when the problem has been fixed.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/SimpleE2ETest/Reader.cpp:

          Fixed error with data size.

Tue Jul 26 22:33:28 USMST 2005  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:
        * dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/SubscriberImpl.cpp:

          Fixed PublisherImpl and Subscriber memory leak.

          Correctly applied the _var and _ptr.

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest3_0/pub_id.txt:

          Removed test generated file.

Fri Jul 22 08:40:18 MST 2005  Scott Harris <harris_s@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpSendStrategy.cpp:

          Make SimpleTcpSendStrategy::send_bytes log the iovec array when
          sendv returns an unexpected errno in hopes of getting it to
          core when the sendv fails for AAC.  Hopefully this will shed
          some light on the problem.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/common.hi:
        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/subscriber.cpp:

          Added -sd <msec> option to allow the subscriber to sleep for
          <msec> milliseconds for every read call.
          This was added to see what would happend if there was a slow
          subscriber.

Wed Jul 20 15:59:55 MST 2005  Trevor Fields  <fields_t@ociweb.com>

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:

Wed Jul 20 15:40:29 MST 2005  Trevor Fields  <fields_t@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/ReceivedDataElementList.inl:

          Corrected comment about why the instance state is not
          deleted in the destructor.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:

          Added delete of queue in destructor.  It was new'd in
          the constructor.

Wed Jul 20 12:11:14 MST 2005  Trevor Fields  <fields_t@ociweb.com>

        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/DataReaderListener.cpp:

          Update and merge the devguide example.  I put it here
          because it proved difficult to integrate into the TAO
          DevGuideExamples directory.

Mon Jul 18 06:43:11 MST 2005  Scott Harris <harris_s@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.h:

          Backed out the change of Thu Jul 14 12:39:15 MST 2005
          because reference_to_servant was fixed in 1.4a_p4.

Sat Jul 16 17:51:05 MST 2005  Scott Harris <harris_s@ociweb.com>

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:

          Make samples replaced in the subscriber's instance queue delete as
          well as free the sample.

        * dds/DCPS/ReceivedDataElementList.inl:

          Added a comment about the ReceivedDataElement destructor
          needing to destroy its InstanceState. But it currently
          causes troubles.

        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/run_test.pl:

          Change the number of samples from 80,000 to 20,000.

Fri Jul 15 16:01:19 MST 2005  Scott Harris <harris_s@ociweb.com>

        * bin/DCPS/CPPTemplate.pm:

          Added Paul C's changes to free read elements in the subscriber
          side instance queue that are being replaced by the recieved
          samples.  It still leaks the if the sample contains a type
          that requires freeing the fields individiually (like sequences).

        * performance-tests/DCPS/TCPListenerTest/run_test.pl:

          Changed this test to just have MAX_SAMPLES and
          MAX_SAMPLES_PER_INSTANCE set to the number that will be in
          the instance queue plus some for good measure.
          Previously it would set MAX_SAMPLES and PER_INSTANCE to
          the number of expected samples.

Thu Jul 14 12:39:15 MST 2005  Scott Harris <harris_s@ociweb.com>

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.h:

          Changed reference_to_servant template to not remove
          a reference to the servant because POA::reference_to_servant
          changed in TAO 1.4a (and 1.4.x) to not increment
          the reference count.

Wed Jul 13 14:03:47 MST 2005  Trevor Fields  <fields_t@ociweb.com>

        * dcps.mpb:

        * dds/DCPS/Definitions.h:
          Changed ACE_Message_Block allocator to use an ACE_Thread_Lock
          The message block's duplicate method was using the same

          All files in ACE_wrappers\TAO\orbsvcs\DDS and
                       ACE_wrappers\TAO\orbsvcs\orbsvcs\DDS and
                       ACE_wrappers\bin\DCPS
          were moved over.
