This is an analysis of possible non-standard hooks into the transport.

What are the possible use cases?
1) publisher detecting when a connection is lost.
	[] need a hook.

1b) publisher detecting when a connection is reestablished.
	As of v0.7 lost connections are not reestablished.

2) subscriber detecting when a connection is lost.
	This can be done by setting liveliness.lease_duration != INFINITE
	so you get a DataReaderListenerImpl::on_liveliness_changed callback.

3) knowing when a reader subscribes
	This is supported by the on_publication_match callback and BIT.

4) knowing when a writer starts publishing (declares the intent to publish by creating a writer).
	This is supported by the on_subscription_match and BIT.

5) knowing when a reader unsubscribes?
	BIT should support this by marking the reader's BIT sample as disposed.

6) knowing when a writer stops publishing?
	BIT should support this by marking the writer's BIT sample as disposed.

7) reader knowing a sample was rejected ( RESOURCE_LIMITS QoS set - new value rejected)
	This is supported by on_sample_rejected call.

8) reader knowing a sample was lost   (RESOURCE_LIMITS == UNLIMITED - oldest value lost)
	This is supported by on_sample_lost call.

9) writer knowing a sample was dropped (on writing side because of backpressure).
	[] need a hook.  Already have a hook from transport to datawriter.
	Existing hook would say that the sample was dropped before sending 
	to at least one reader but not how many or which readers.

10) Has a sample been sent to all subscribers.
	[] need a hook. Already have a hook from transport to datawriter.
	Is part of proposed extensions to the spec. "Inspection of reliable status"

11) Has a sample been sent to a specific subscriber.
	[] need a hook.
	Is part of proposed extensions to the spec. "Inspection of reliable status"




========================= detailed analysis =========================
1) publisher detecting when a connection is lost.

The transport knows which entity ids are associated with each link/connection so when 
it fails to establish or is lost after being established it could tell the publisher
to call the appropriate listener.

I suggest that we extend the PublisherListener to have communication_lost 
and communication_reestablished callbacks.
They will both have parameters similar to liveliness lost (the datawriter and status counts).

Should we do the same for the subscription side even though it can use on_liveliness_changed
to provide a similar functionality?

1b) see 1) above.


3,4,5,6) require that we get the BIT implementation to work properly.
	3 and 4 have a limited solution (subscribe count but not specifically who) without BIT.

9) & 10)
We could extend the PublisherListener to provide a sample_dropped and a sample_delivered callbacks.
Sample_delivered() would mean that it has been sent to all readers (for reliable it means they 
all Acked it; for unreliable it just means it was sent).
sample_dropped() would mean that it is being dropped and was not sent to one or more readers.
It should include a count of sent_to and unsent_to associations.
