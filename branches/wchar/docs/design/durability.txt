DURABILITY
(RxO == YES ; Mutable == NO)
[ Topic, DataReader, DataWriter ]

Default == VOLATILE, with "service_cleanup_delay" == 0.

This policy, along with the LIFESPAN, HISTORY and RESOURCE_LIMITS policy
values, determines the lifetime of data written to DataWriters.  This data
is potentially made available to DataReaders which join after the data
has been written and delivered to the previously existing subscribers.
This policy is implemented entirely by the instance data container of
the DataWriter.  This container is required and bounded by the HISTORY
and RESOURCE_LIMITS policies.

This policy is considered during the creation of associations between
DataWriters and DataReaders.  The value of both sides of the association
must be compatible in order for an association to be created.  This value
of this policy may not change after the associated Entity is enabled.

The VOLATILE value requires no behavior for implementation.  Data may be
discarded at any time after delivery, and is not available to DataReaders
which join after data is written; these readers will receive only
data written after they join.  This is the default value and must be
implemented to comply with the specification.

The TRANSIENT_LOCAL value requires that the contents of the instance
data container last for the lifetime of the DataWriter for that
instance.  Support for this value must be implemented to comply with
the specification.

The TRANSIENT value requires that the contents of the instance data
container last for potentially longer than the DataWriter.  It is not
required to outlive the process in which it was created.  The value of
the "service_cleanup_delay" is used to determine when to discard data
for this value.  Support for this value is optional by the implementation.

The PERSISTENT value requires that the contents of the instance data
container last for potentially longer than the process in which they
are created.  This implies that the data must be stored in a persistent
store and can be reloaded in cases where the originating process is
terminated before the data expires.  The retention and discarding of data
for this value is determined in the same way as for the TRANSIENT value.
The only difference between this value and the TRANSIENT value is that
data can last longer than the originating process for the PERSISTENT
value.  Support for this value is optional by the implementation.

Implementation notes:

The KIND=PERSISTENT implementation synchronizes the data samples for
an instance with a backing store.  This synchronization will be done
as close as possible to the creation of the data sample to allow the
retention of as much data as possible.  OpenDDS will not block write
processing to wait for the backing store to be synchronized.

A single backing store will be used for all instances implementing this
policy value within a single executing process.  The Service_Participant
manages the backing store itself.  On systems that support it, a
directly memory mapped file should be used to provide the backing store.
Best efforts will be made to keep the data consistent in the presence of
catastrophic process termination, but no guarantees are made.

When a process is started and creates its Service_Participant it can be
configured to attach to a single backing store.  The backing store will be
read at startup and any instance data present will be loaded into memory.
It will be checked to see if it has aged off for any reason and discarded
if it is not still active.  Active samples are then made available to the
service entities identically to the way they are made available in the
KIND==TRANSIENT case.  It may not be possible to check for all possible
mechanisms to age off the instance data until the DomainParticipant and
Publisher entities or even the DataWriters have been created in order
to check the QoS policy values.

The KIND==TRANSIENT implementation is described by the specification as
being implemented using a fictitious built-in "persistence service".
This service has a DataReader that matches the instances having the
TRANSIENT or PERSISTENT values and the DataWriter provides the instance
samples to newly joining DataReaders that have the corresponding policy
value.

While it is tempting to implement this fictitious persistence service, it
is not possible to obtain the desired behavior by simply creating new
DataWriter and DataReader objects.  The interactions of DataWriters and
DataReaders with the repository and the establishment of associations
between the fictitious entities and the actual entities would complicate
the existing service operations.  The associations would likely be
attempted through a transport implementation as well.

To provide this level of service, the QoS policy values need to be
checked by the originating Publisher as associations are made.  Only for
cases where a DataReader has requested TRANSIENT or PERSISTENT data and
it is provided by the DataWriter will data be sent to the newly joining
subscriber.  The Topic and the DURABILITY_SERVICE QoS policy values are
used as the fictitious persistence service entity policy values for cases
where a full association is not made with actual service entities.

In the case where a new subscriber is registered with the repository for
a publication which has available samples to be delivered but which has
no current DataWriter the fictitious DataWriter will send the available
samples.

Where a DataWriter is created, writes data, and is deleted before a
DataReader has been associated with it, the fictitious DataReader will
receive the samples and they will be stored.

  DataWriter
    kind==VOLATILE
      No implementation processing required.

    kind==TRANSIENT_LOCAL
      No implementation processing required.  The instance data is
      stored in WriteDataContainer objects which provide this level
      of DURABILITY.

    kind==TRANSIENT

    kind==PERSISTENT (Optional for compliance)
      This operates identically to the TRANSIENT behavior described
      above.

      No implementation processing required.

    kind==TRANSIENT
      TBD

    kind==PERSISTENT (Optional for compliance)
      This operates identically to the TRANSIENT behavior described above.
      It also synchronizes the durable samples with the backing storage
      via the Service_Participant.

      When a DataWriter is being created, the Publisher will check the
      backing store managed by the Service_Participant and if there are
      available instance samples that match the new DataWriter the data
      will be transferred to it.
