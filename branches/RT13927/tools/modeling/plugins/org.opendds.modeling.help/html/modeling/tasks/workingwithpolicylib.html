  <h2>Working with Policy Libraries</h2>

  <p>Policy libraries allow QoS Policy settings to be re-used by
  various DCPS domain elements defined in DCPS Libraries.</p>

  <h3>Creating Policy Libraries</h3>

  <p>You can create a "library" of QoS policies that can be re-used
  by different DCPS domain elements.</p>

  <p>From the main diagram a Policy Library can be created by
  either double-clicking on the PolicyLib tool in the palette, or
  by clicking on the PolicyLib tool and then dragging the region on
  the diagram surface that the policy library figure should occupy.
  After that specify the name to use for the library.</p>

  <p>The library can then be opened by double-clicking on the
  library. A new diagram editor will be opened (using the same
  diagram file used for the main diagram).</p>

  <h3>Adding Policies</h3>

  <p>For policies that you would like to provide custom settings
  for, select the policy from the palette and add it to the
  canvas.</p>

  <h3>Validation of Policies</h3>

  <p>Before using your policy library you should have validations
  performed first. See <a href=
  "performingvalidations.html">Performing Validations</a> to learn
  how to do validations.</p>
