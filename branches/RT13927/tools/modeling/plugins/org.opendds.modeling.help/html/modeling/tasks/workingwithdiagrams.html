<h2>Working with Diagrams</h2>

<h3>Setting element attributes</h3>

<p>Many of the OpenDDS SDK elements have attributes for you to set. To set
an attribute, after the attribute is selected, click on it and enter the
value for it. The steps are shown below, using a QoS Policy as an example.</p>

<p>Create the element. For example, double-click on the element in the Palette.
This will put the element with undefined attributes on it (in this example, the policy
name and value):</p>

<p>To set the value attribute, first select it. (It may be necessary to first click
somewhere outside the figure to have it un-selected, and then re-select the figure.)</p>

<p>Now click on the attribute and an input box will appear allowing you to type in the
attribute value. The name of the attribute will temporarily disappear while you are
editing.</p>

<p>After editing you should see the name of the attribute followed by it's value:</p>

<h3>Connecting Figures</h3>

<p>For figures that are intended to be connected to each other, connection
creation assistants can be used. When hovering your mouse over a figure to
be connected, connection handlers will appear as shown below.</p>

<img alt="Connection handles" src="../images/diagram_connection_handles.png">

<p>If both the source and target figures already exist on the diagram, you
can directly connect them in one of two ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the selected figure is to be the connection <i>source</i>, you can then connect to a target figure
by clicking on the box on the outgoing arrow and dragging to the target.</li>
<li>If the selected figure is to be the connection <i>target</i>, you can click on the box on the
incoming arrow and drag to the source figure.</li>
</ul>

<p>An alternative way to make connections is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the selected figure is to be the <i>source</i> figure, click on the box connected to the connection
handle's outgoing arrow and drag to empty portion of the canvas. You will then be prompted
to create allowed target figures, or to select from existing figures on the diagram.</li>
<li>If the selected figure is to be the <i>target</i> figure, click on the box connected to the connection
handle's incoming arrow and drag to empty portion of the canvas. You will then be prompted
to create allowed source figures,</li>
</ul>

<p>An example connection menu for source figure is shown below.</p>

<img alt="Source's target menu" src="../images/diagram_connection_sources_target_menu.png">

<div id="note">
<p>As you may have discovered by now, you can also create a connection to a Note figure. While this
is a great way to help document your model, keep in mind that notes are associated with the diagram
only and are not part of the domain model itself.</p>
</div>

<p>Once connected, the target figure will have the arrow connected to it. An example connection is shown
below.</p>

<h3>Moving between diagrams</h3>

<p>In the course of working with the various libraries in an OpenDDS SDK model, you may find yourself
with numerous diagram edit windows open. To make it easy to move and forth between these windows you
can use the Back and Forward buttons on the Eclipse toolbar that are shown below.</p>
