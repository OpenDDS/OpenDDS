== Modified API ======================================================

In order to allow the application to establish relationships
supporting communication with DDS services managed by separate
InfoRepo repositories, the following modifications to the API
are made:

======================================================================

From inspection, any code that uses the existing API will be
unaffected.  The two existing methods were extended by adding call
parameters with defaults, allowing existing code to compile and
execute without modification.

The get_repository() method is used internally by the service and
any existing application code that uses this method is in error.

In the case where additional DDS services, managed by distinct
repositories, is desired, the full API will need to be used.
The use of these interfaces follows the pattern of:

  1) Set the repository IOR values in the service using
     set_repo_ior().

  2) Bind domains to the repositories using set_repo_domain().

The ability to specify these relationships statically is also
provided through the use of subsections in the configuration file.
These sections are arranged as:

======================================================================

[domain/<domainname>]
DomainId      = <::DDS::DomainId_t value>
DomainRepoKey = <::OpenDDS::DCPS::Service_Participant::RepoKey value>

[repository/<reponame>]
RepositoryKey = <::OpenDDS::DCPS::Service_Participant::RepoKey value>
RepositoryIor = <CORBA IOR locating the repository>

======================================================================

There can be as many [domain/*] sections as desired, as long
as the DomainId values are distinct within the application.
The DomainRepoKey value must refer to a key value defined as a
RepositoryKey in a [repository/*] within the same configuration.

There can be as many [repository/*] sections as desired, as long
as the RepositoryKey values are distinct within the application.

The sections can appear in any order.

Once an application has been configured using a configuration file,
the application may add repositories and bind them to domains using
the API as described above.  This may be done at any point during
the lifetime of the application.

Internal to the OpenDDS service code, the Built In Topics
are attached to a separate transport implementation for each
repository with which we are communicating.  The TransportId for
these transports is derived from the BIT_ALL_TRAFFIC constant as a
base to which the RepoKey value for the specific repository is added.
It is the reponsibility of the application to avoid collisions with
these key values.

== Rationale =========================================================

The DDS specification (07-01-01) indicates that DDS provides
a data centric service for a "global data space" defined by the
conceptual model.  OpenDDS implements the meta-information about the
service and the global data space in a DCPS Information Repository
(InfoRepo).  In the current implementation, application processes
access the InfoRepo through CORBA IDL interfaces.  These interfaces
are accessed by each process participating in the DDS service.
Since this was implementing the conceptual global data space, the
initial version did not anticipate the existence of more than one
source for the service meta-information.

As OpenDDS matures, the practicalities of implementation has resulted
in the existence of multiple InfoRepo objects, serving independent
segments of DDS services.  A natural extension of this is to require
the ability to have a single application participate in more than
one independently managed DDS service segment at a time.

This can be implemented in many different ways, including:
1) providing a single distributed InfoRepo that manages all possible
DDS service segments; 2) providing a way for individual InfoRepo
objects to be federated to allow coordination between them;
3) distributing the repository functionality across all service
participants; or, 4) requiring the application to manage any
potential conflicts between the segments managed by different
InfoRepo objects.

The simplest mechanism is to require the application to manage
potential conflicts.  This does not preclude future implementations
of either fully distributed or federated service management.
This simplest mechanism is also easily implemented by extensions
to the DDS service API used by applications.

Potential conflicts between service segments managed by separate
repositories include: 1) Domain ID conflicts; and, 2) application
resource conflicts.

Domain ID conflicts require that the system in which more than one
repository will be used to partition domains within the system and
not just within any single repository.  This is necessary since all
service related information is keyed by the DomainId.  Finding the
same domain within two different repositories would create ambiguity
when accessing service information for that domain.  e.g. finding
the DomainParticipant or any of its contained entities would need
to include the repository, which is not part of the specification
interfaces.  This is beyond the scope of the OpenDDS implementation.
If it is not possible for the system design to partition the domains,
then applications desiring to participate in services having these
conflicts will be more difficult.  e.g. requiring intermediate
processes to translate or republish information to mitigate the
domain ID conflicts.

Application resource conflicts need to be managed by the application
through its implicit knowledge of the different service repositories.
The OpenDDS service API needs to provide methods to allow for
resources used by the application to perform this management.
Memory resources are currently local to the individual DataWriters
and DataReaders, so these do not require active management.

In addition to memory, the transport implementations attached to the
service need to be managed.  The current transport implementations
can only be used within the scope of a single repository, so the
application will need to create at least one transport for each
attached repository.  Since each InfoRepo publishes the Built In
Topics that it manages, the OpenDDS Service_Participant manages the
creation and attachment of a separate transport to each repository
for these topics.  There is no requirement for the application to
perform any of the Built In Topic transport management.

The OpenDDS Service_Participant must allow individual repositories
to be bound to specific domains.  This is a 1 (repository) to many
(domain Id) relationship.  Since the Service_Participant currently
manages the transport for the Built In Topics for the service,
a transport needs to be created for each individual repository.
This is a 1 (repository) to 1 (transport) relationship.
