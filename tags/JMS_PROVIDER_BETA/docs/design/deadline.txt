DEADLINE
(RxO == YES ; Mutable == YES)
[ Topic, DataReader, DataWriter ]

Default is deadline_period == infinite.

This policy means that DataReaders expect to see changes in data before
the deadline_period expires. The client application will guarantee that
it will write new data before the deadline_period expires.

This policy is considered during the creation of associations between
DataWriters and DataReaders.  The value of both sides of the association
must be compatible in order for an association to be created.  This value
of this policy may change after the associated Entity is enabled.  In the
case where the policy of a DataReader or DataWriter is made, the change
is successful (applied) only if the change remains consistent with the
remote end of all associations in which the DataReader or DataWriter
is participating.  If the policy of a Topic is changed, it will affect
only DataReaders and DataWriters that are created after the change has
been made.  Any existing DataReaders or DataWriters, and any existing
associations between them, will not be affected by the Topic policy
value change.

The default value of deadline_period == infinite requires no behavior.
When this policy is set to a finite value, then the DataWriter monitors
the changes to data made by the application and indicates the failure
to honor the policy by triggering the on_offered_deadline_missed()
Listener callback or setting the corresponding status condition.
A DataReader which detects that the data has not changed before the
deadline_period has expired triggers the on_requested_deadline_missed()
Listener callback or sets the corresponding status condition.

Implementation_notes:

  DCPSInfo
    Compatibility processing, see spec.

  Topic
    No implementation processing required.

  DataWriter
    Sets timer using DDS orb reactor.

    constructor()    - if value not default, setup timer and start it.
    write_*()        - reset timer.
    set_qos()        - compatibility processing on change after enable().
                       Incompatible values fail to make change.
    timer->timeout() - call on_offered_deadline_missed();

  DataReader
    Sets timer using DDS orb reactor.

    constructor()    - if value not default, setup timer and start it.
    data_received()  - reset timer.
    set_qos()        - compatibility processing on change after enable().
                       Incompatible values fail to make change.
