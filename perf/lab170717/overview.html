<h2>Overview</h2>
Performance tests of the OpenDDS implementation was performed and the results are presented here.  This testing was done using the pre-release code for OpenDDS version 3.12.  These tests were executed in the OCI lab test environment.<br><br>The testing was performed using the OpenDDS-Bench performance testing framework.  This framework is currently located at <em>$DDS_ROOT/performance-tests/Bench</em>.  The configuration files for these tests are included in the OpenDDS download file and can be used to repeat the testing in a users environment.  This will let users compare existing or other candidate data transport mechanisms in their specific target environment.<br><br><div class="centeredTable"><table class="twtable"><caption align="top"> Available Tests Results </caption><tbody><tr class="evenRow"><td align="center">Date</td><td align="center">Test</td><td align="center">Environment</td><td align="center">Results</td></tr><tr class="oddRow"><td align="center">July 17, 2017</td><td align="center">Latency</td><td align="center">OCI test lab</td><td align="center"><a class="externalLink null" href="latency_results.html">summary</a>, <a class="externalLink null" href="latency_details.html">details</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
