<h2>Latency Results</h2>
The results of executing the latency testing are included here.  More
detailed information is included in the <a class="externalLink null"
href="latency_details.html">Latency Details</a> table.  These results
include latency and jitter.  <span style="color: red;"> These tests were
executed on time shared hosts with other system activity present.
Executing on hosts with real-time operating systems and schedulers would
allow the system designers to choose how the processing for data
distribution and applications would interact and reduce the jitter to the
levels required by the system.</span><br><br>Latency for the TCP, UDP,
best effort Multicast, and reliable Multicast transports are shown in the
diagram below.  Latency was measured by taking a timestamp in the
originating process, inserting that timestamp into the data sample and
sending it.  When the data sample is received in the terminating process,
another timestamp is generated and the latency is defined as the
different between these two timestamps.  This means that the latency
numbers include the OpenDDS transport latency <em>plus</em> the system
and network transport latencies <em>plus</em> the time to copy the entire
data sample since the timestamps are from the start of sending to the end
of receiving.  The time to copy the message bytes is what causes the
latency charts below to have a linear aspect over the message sizes,
since as the message size increases, there are more bytes to
transport.<br><br>Since the latency tests were not stressing the network
or the hosts capacities, the performance for all of the transports is
comparable.  This is to be expected as the performance of the reliable
transports without rate limiting (TCP) or packet loss (reliable
Multicast) means that the latency is dominated by the underlying IP
datagram transport performance.<br><br>The
latencies below are in microseconds and are plotted
against the size of the message being sent.<br><br><img

is defined as the time variation of latency on successive samples.
