Attributes Test:
The goal of this test suite is to allow easy testing of various combinations of securtiy attributes for both publishers
(writers) and subscribers (readers). In order to accomplish this, every possible permutation of attributes has been generated
for a single domain (in this case, domain "0") within the governance files found in the governance directory. This includes
both the global security attributes (which will determine the goverance file name) and the topic attributes (which will
determine the topic name within the governance file). See naming sections below for help in determining the mapping between
names and attribute values. In order to support the testing of various security configuration combinations, the publisher
and subscriber test processes allow for many of the security-related QoS configuration settings to be specified from the
command line, and as a result the "run_test" perl script also supports a variety of these configuration options. Most notably,
several "scenarios" have been defined to test specific configuration combinations, all of which can be run by passing the --scenario
flag to the run script along with the scenario name.

Naming for Governance files:
AU / PU                  : Allow Unauthenticated / Prohibit Unauthenticated
UA / PA                  : Unprotected Access / Protected Access
ND / SD / ED / SOD / EOD : Not protected / Signed / Encrypted / Signed with Origin authentication / Encrypted with Origin authentication Discovery
NL / SL / EL / SOL / EOL : Not protected / Signed / Encrypted / Signed with Origin authentication / Encrypted with Origin authentication Liveliness
NR / SR / ER / SOR / EOR : Not protected / Signed / Encrypted / Signed with Origin authentication / Encrypted with Origin authentication RTPS

Naming for Topics:
OD / PD                  : Open / Protected Discovery
OL / PL                  : Open / Protected Liveliness
OA / RA / WA / RWA       : Open / Read / Write / ReadWrite Access
OM / SM / EM / SOM / EOM : Open / Signed / Encrypted / Signed with Origin authentication / Encrypted with Origin authentication Meta-data
OD / SD / ED             : Open / Signed / Encrypted Data

Note:
Governance files in the governance directory have been automatically generated using "governance/gov_gen.cpp".

In the unlikely event you need to build gov_gen, you should be able to simply run g++ to build it:
g++ -o gov_gen gov_gen.cpp -Wall -pedantic -std=c++11
