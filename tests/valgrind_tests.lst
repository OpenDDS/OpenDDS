# This is the list of run_test.pl's that need to be run by
# auto_run_tests.pl.
# Each line has its own test, and a test can be followed by a
# list of configurations required to be enabled (or not
# enabled if preceded by !). For example,
#
# tests/DCPS/SomeText/run_test.pl rtps: !DCPS_MIN RTPS

# means to run if the build is not a minimal test and RTPS is enabled.
