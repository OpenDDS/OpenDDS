Verify bug fix of view state.

The samples of same instance returned from a read/take operation should
have same view state. The view state is only changed when the samples
from most recent generation are actually read.

Both publication and subscription work in the main thread
to simplify the coordination of writes and reads.

run_test.pl will run the test but here is how to do it by hand:

It needs to launch DCPSInfoRepo:

  $DDS_ROOT/bin/DCPSInfoRepo -o repo.ior -d domain_ids

Command line option:

    // options:
    //  -z                          verbose transport debug

run the test

./main -DcpsBit 0  -ORBSvcConf ../../tcp.conf
