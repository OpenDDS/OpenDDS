This test verifies the basics of the repository federation operation.
This work was done as part if RT11951.  It includes:

1) start 2 repositories;
   attach a publisher to one repository;
   attach a subscriber to the other repository;
   federate the repositories;
   send data.

NOTE!
Currently this test is a placeholder for verifying the implementation of
repository federation.  This will be extended as federation is
implemented.

Until federation is implemented, this test does not check any additional
features of DDS.
