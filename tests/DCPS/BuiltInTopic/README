This simple test is to test the builtin topics on the client side.
The test application creates participant, publisher, datawriter,
subscriber and datareader and looks for the builtin topic data via
the builtin subscriber in participant.

It also tests the ignore* interface in DomainParticipant.

Builtin topic basic function test:

  run_test.pl

  - start the DCPSInfo server.

    ../../../../DDS/DCPSInfoRepo -o repo.ior -d domain_ids

  - start the unittest client with the orb initialized by the Service_Participant.

    ./bit -DCPSInfoRepo file://$iorfile


Ingore* interface tests are done by passing the -i option.

   run_test.pl ignore_part
   run_test.pl ignore_topic
   run_test.pl ignore_pub
   run_test.pl ignore_sub
