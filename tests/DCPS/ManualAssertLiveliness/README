This test is to test the MANUAL_BY_PARTICIPANT_LIVELINESS_QOS
and MANUAL_BY_TOPIC_LIVELINESS_QOS support.

The test creates 4 writers and all associte with 1 reader.
Two writers are created with MANUAL_BY_PARTICIPANT_LIVELINESS_QOS
and two are created with MANUAL_BY_TOPIC_LIVELINESS_QOS. They have
same lease duration. The first M_BY_P writer asserts liveliness via
DomainParticipant::assert_liveliness call and the second M_BY_P writer
asserts liveliness via write(). The first M_BY_T writer asserts
liveliness via DataWriter::assert_liveliness and the second M_BY_T
writer asserts liveliness via write(). The operations were performed
every lease duration.

The subscriber will expect some liveliness changed calls.
For the test never miss liveliness (run "run_test.pl"), it expect 8
callbacks (2 for each writer when it bacomes alive upon
add_associations and when it becomes dead upon remove_associations).

For the test miss liveliness (run "run_test.pl lost"), it expect 16
callbacks (4 for each writer when it bacomes alive upon
add_associations, becomes dead because no liveliness message or
sample read in, becomes active as there is liveliness message or
sample read in, becomes dead upon remove_associations).
