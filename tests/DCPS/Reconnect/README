** sub_init_crash test case

The new test script option 'sub_init_crash' tests the scenario in rt 9123

The Subscriber is killed (simulating a crash) after initialization.
The Publisher then crashes during its initialization.


** dl_clean test case

The new test script option 'dl_clean' tests a bug(RT11348) in DDS transport that the
DataLinkCleanupTask removes the new associations. This happens when new association
is added to a datalink that was declared to release resource due to disconnect.

To reproduce the problem before the bug fix, follow steps:

1) Apply following patch to add a delay between prepare_release and release_link_resources
   calls.

   this->prepare_release ();

+  ACE_OS::sleep (10);

   return impl_->release_link_resources (this);
 }


2) Run dl_clean test.

cd $DDS_ROOT/tests/DCPS/Reconnect
./run_test.pl dl_clean

3) Symptom:  The test will stop receiving any messages after second subscriber
start about 10 seconds. It finally output "test FAILED".


To verify the bug was fixed, the patch above needs be applied.
Run $DDS_ROOT/tests/DCPS/Reconnect/run_test.pl dl_clean test.
The restarted subscriber continue receiving messages until test
finish and it finally output "test PASSED".

Since it needs special patch for this bug fix, this test case
can not be added to automated nightly builds.
