A basic system feature test:



1) Single datawriter and single datareader test cases:

  run_test.pl          - single instance, TCP

  run_test.pl udp      - single instance, UDP

  run_test.pl mi       - multiple instances, TCP

  run_test.pl udp mi   - multiple instances, UDP

  run_test.pl nokey mi - no key, TCP

    Note: No key tests just have one instance.
          We pass "mi" for using the same parameters as in multiple
          instances test.

  run_test.pl nokey udp mi  - no key, UDP


  run_test.pl blocking          - long timeout of writes, TCP

  run_test.pl blocking_timeout  - short timeout of writes, TCP


2) Multiple datawriter and multiple datareader test cases:


  run_test.pl mwmr  - two datawriters and two datareaders, TCP

  run_test.pl mwmr_long_seq   - Foo type contain a 256 float sequence,
                                two datawriters, two datareaders, TCP

  run_test.pl mixed_trans      - Two datawriters - one using TCP,
                                                  one using UDP.
                                Two datareaders - one using TCP,
                                                  one using UDP.


Note: This test can optionally use the MCast transport.

  run_test.pl mcast

 The test is statically linked with the MCast transport library and static
 initialization happens at process initialization (as opposed to run-time
 dynamic linking & initialization).
