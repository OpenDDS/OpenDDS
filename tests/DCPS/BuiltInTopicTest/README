A test for Built-In-Topic (BIT) implementation. The purpose of this test is
to verify that newer and older participants receive the same BIT data.

Test steps:

1) start InfoRepo
2) start monitor1 process which just creates a domain participant. It reads
   bit data via bit datareader after a few seconds.
3) start publisher which creates a domain participant and a datawriter.
4) start subscriber which creates a domain participant and a datareader.
5) start monitor2 process which just creates a domain participant and reads
   the bit data via bit datareader.

The monitor1 and monitor2 should both get following bit info.

 4 domainparticipants,
 2 topics,
 1 datareader
 1 datawriter

prst_repo_run_test.pl does something similar with InfoRepo persistence
enabled. The InfoRepo is shutdown in the middle of the test and new Repo
is started. The new Repo should read the persistence data and the test
will verify the BIT data with the second monitor.
