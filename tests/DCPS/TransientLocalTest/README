A test for TRANSIENT_LOCAL_DURABILITY_QOS implementation.
The datawriter with the TRANSIENT_LOCAL_DURABILITY_QOS durability should
resend the sending and sent samples to the newly associated datareaders.

This test is also used to test the fix for a deadlock situation. The deadlock
happens between fully_associated() thread and write()/register() thread when
using TRANSIENT_LOCAL_DURABILITY_QOS. The fully_associated() thread calls the
PublisherImpl::data_available() function which acquires the publisher lock and
then the writer container lock while the write()/register() thread acquires
writer container lock and then the publisher lock. To fix the lock reverse order
problem, the fully_associated() was changed to acquire the writer container
lock before calling PublisherImpl::data_available().

To simulate the deadlock test scenario, the PublisherImpl::data_availabe()
need be modified to have sleep for 2 seconds before send(list) if
resend is true. The patch of the $DDS_ROOT/dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.cpp is
attached here.

Without the fix, this test will encounter a deadlock. With the fix, the test
should pass.
