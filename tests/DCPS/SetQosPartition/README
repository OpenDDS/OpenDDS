This is to test the behavior how DCPSInfoRepo re-evaluate the
compatibility and associations when the PARTITION QoS policy
is changed. The PARTICIPANT QoS should not fail the compatibility
checking but may cause associations changes.


Test sequence:

- The DataWriter has compatible PARTITION with first DataReader, but
  not second DataReader. So first DataReader receives samples but
  second does not receive samples.

- The DataWriter reset PARTITION to be compatible with second DataReader
  but not first DataReader, then the second DataReader is associated
  with the DataWriter but the first DataReader is disassociated.

- First DataReader reset PARTITION to be compatible with the DataWriter
  so both DataReaders receives sample from DataWriter.
