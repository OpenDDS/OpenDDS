Verify transport configuration scenarios for DDS Transport Configuration Enhancements
Part of RT#13920 (https://support.ociweb.com/Ticket/Display.html?id=13920)

run_test.pl
  Runs multiple scenarios, each consisting of a separate publisher and subscriber process.

Use Case Partitioning

Individual use-cases can be identified by a tuple of values: (s, e, c, t), where s is the Configuration name to use, e is the Entity, c is the Collocation type, and t is the Effective transport. Each combination of Entity, Source, Collocation and Transport describes a use-case. A test based on the use case will assertain that in the given configuration, a specific transport has been selected by the data writer and the reader.

For example, (ReaderWriter, None, Host, _OPENDDS_0500_TCP) describes an use where entities run on the same host, but in separate address spaces; the configuration data file is not provided; the case applies to both the Reader and the Writer. Possible Entities are None (none), ReaderWriter (rw), PublisherSubscriber (pubsub), and domain Participant (participant). Configuration is either None, or a named configuration of potentialy many transports, provided through a configuration file. Collocation type determines relative entity distribution: None, Memory, Host, and Network.

Source: None
No explicitly provided configuration and DDS defults apply.

Source: (name)
Transport configuration name is explicitly provided in the accompanying INI-formatted file.

Entity: None
None of the entities has bound to explicitly provided configuration. No setup/configuration code is used either.

Entity: ReaderWriter (rw)
Transport configuration is applied at the Reader (Writer) entity level.

Entity: PublisherSubscriber (pubsub)
Transport configuration is applied at the Subscriber (Publisher) entity level. The effective transport chosen by the reader/writer shall be inherited from Subscriber (Publisher)'s configuration.

Entity: Domain Participant
Transport configuration is applied at the Domain Participant entity level. The effective transport chosen by the reader/writer shall be inherited from Subscriber (Publisher)'s configuration, which in turn is derived from Domain Participant's configuration.

Collocation: None
Refers to the cases where relative spatial distribution of communicating entities is of no consequence, because we are interested in testing the effective transport configuration. Not the negotiated transport configuration.

Collocation: Memory
Refers to the cases where the two communicating processes have access to the same address space (are in the same process instance).

Collocation: Host
Refers to the cases where the two communicating processes have access to shared memory (are physically on the same host).

Collocation: Network
For example, same or different network segments for UDP. Or, same or different networks for TCP


All Possible Use Cases

No configuration, None participant, None collocation
Is this a trivial use case that does not need any tests? Perhaps, it can be used to assert what the default transport configuration is?

...

No configuration, None participant, Network collocation
...

No configuration, Reader/Writer, None collocation
Test that the explicit transport configuration for the Entity supersedes the default transport configuration. The other Entities must have the same as the default transport configuration.
